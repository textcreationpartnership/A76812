            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He great engagements in which I ſtand by many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours received, to much Honoured friends of yours, put me on, to ſend forth a former Treatiſe into pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick view under their names. This being of ſo near affinity, I thought it meet that it ſhould come abroad under the Patronage of one of ſo near alliance. I need not mention my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular engagements, which you do not deſire I know to hear. Since the time, that after your great imployments hath at home and abroad, in affaires of State God hath been pleaſed to ſeat you in theſe parts; your ſingular candour towards all thoſe that labour in the Work, to which through grace I am called is eminently ſeen. You were tenderly conſciencious, without great caution put, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture on the purchaſe of a Mannor to which an Impropriation was annext, which yet for many reaſons you could not without great inconvenience avoid. And notwithſtanding a Vicarage there endowed, which others (though not you) would have judged a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency, your great care was as ſoon as you were fully poſſeſſed, finding an Incumbent there, whom you had no reaſon to encourage, nor power to remove, to ſuperinduce others, one after other, in a more happy, and edifying way; to carry on that work. It was no ſooner void, but you took care to ſettle one of eminent gifts and graces, with that liberal munificence, that a free School for poor children, built at your proper coſt, being provided for, little remains yours, of that part of your purchaſe. Your ſollicitous care is ſtill, no leſſe (whereof there are many knowing witneſſes) how to ſettle it with all poſsible ſpeed upon poſterity, in ſuch a way, that God
<pb facs="tcp:168215:3"/> may be moſt honoured, and piety advanced by it. Which alſo (as I have heard from your own mouth) your much honoured and pious Lady deceaſed, did often perſwade to haſten; although ſhe well knew, that out of your love to her, you had by your laſt Will and Teſtament deviſed to her, that whole Lordſhip of <hi>Polesworth</hi> (to a fourth part whereof ſhe was heir) and all the reſt of your Eſtate in theſe parts, for an increaſe of her Joynture. If the Lord Chriſt tells us, that the coſt which that Pious woman ſpent on him, ſhould be told for a memorial of her, whereſoever in the world the Goſpel ſhould be preacht; I ſuppoſe that this which you have done, may be mentioned for your honour, with hers, that reſts in the Lord: whereſoever this ſmall piece by Providence ſhall come to be read. I may well look upon you, as one of the moſt acute of my Readers: If therefore this may gain your favour, I ſhall have leſſe cauſe to fear others cenſure; Though in ſo great variety of things, as are here toucht upon, and ſo much controverſal, I cannot expect that any one ſhould ſubſcribe to every piece. The whole may be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, though ſome part remain under diſpute. As it fares with me in reading the Labours of many others, ſo I may well expect that it will be with others, in reading any thing of mine. Your great zeal, as to the whole of the worſhip of God, ſo to this part here treated of, where you are known, cannot be hid. Your complaint hath often been, of the ſad neglect of the Lords Supper; and it lyes as a ſad burden on the ſpirits of many eminently Pious ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt, that they ſee not a door opened for their comfortable, and orderly adminiſtration and participation of it. If any thing be here ſaid to give any further light in theſe ſacred myſteries, and to facilitate the way of adminiſtration to pious diſpenſers, ſo, as the honour of the Ordinance may be preſerved, and the edification of ſoules promoted, I have that which I deſire, and have made my endeavour. The Lord honour your hoare hairs with everlaſting dayes, and give you the comfort of all that you have done, in, and for his Name: Sir, I am</p>

And if I would cut by this pattern, and that either the Reverend Author, whoſe learned Works have already ſpoken him to the Church: Or this Judicious Treatiſe which now fitly followes its elder brother under the name of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſealed,</hi> ſtood in need of an Epiſtle Commendatory, I ſhould not be aſhamed, both to teſtifie my honour of the man, and my valuation of his Work; and yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I, nor any other man in this caſe ought to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, as <gap reason="foreign">

<pb facs="tcp:168215:4"/> ſcope of the Authour in this work. 2. The pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance thereof as to the main. The ſcope is rare, <hi>viz.</hi> An Eſſay to find a way of regular admiſſion unto, and holy adminiſtration of the Lords Supper, between thoſe extreams of promiſcuous intruſion on the one hand, and the total forbearance of it on the other, both which do afflict the ſpirits of the godly that are caſt into broken Congregations all the Land over without Card or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe to ſteer by to their comfort; and ſo it is very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be a <hi>word ſpoken upon his wheeles</hi> to many Miniſters, who may find here a thred to direct them out of thoſe labyrinths and perplexities out of which they find it hard to extricate themſelves.</p>
                  <p>And then in purſuance of this main ſcope, and indeed in all the parts of the Treatiſe that I have read: Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are balanced and pondered ſo Judiciouſly, and there is ſo much demonſtration of acuteneſſe of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſolidity of reaſon, ſweetneſſe and candour of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that if thou in reading diſlodge prejudice, and hold the ſcale even, I hope thou ſhalt not write upon thy pains, <hi>Labour in vain.

It is true, he speaks of it onely as a ſeal, whereby <hi>Abraham</hi> did aſſure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto God, to be his, whereas the Apoſtle speakes of it as a ſeal, whereby God did confirm his Covenant unto <hi>Abraham.</hi> But the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant being mutual, wherein God doth engage himſelf unto man, and man doth ingage himſelf unto God, the Sacraments as ſeales of the Covenant, ſerve to confirm both the one and the other ingagement. Now the Sacraments thus having reſpect unto the Covenant, and ſtanding in a ſubſerviency unto it, this reverend Author (Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>) having by Divine aſſiſtance compoſed and publiſhed a Treatiſe of the Covenant, which deſervedly hath found good acceptance, by the good hand of his God ſtill upon him doth now offer to publick view a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the Sacraments, which (I preſume) will be no leſſe accepted.

Where he doth a little ſtep aſide out of the road, he doth it not out of any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of contradiction, not with any uncivil cenſure, or petulant expreſſion, but as with ſome rational plea, ſo with much modeſt deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As here in this Treatiſe, where he holds, that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as appendants to the Word, may be profitable to the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and inſtrumentall to Converſion. And yet he doth withall largely and learnedly impugne the Phyſical operation of Sacraments, which doth no more follow upon the other (as ſome perhaps may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine) then the Phyſicall operation of the Word, which all explode, and yet confeſſe that the Word is an inſtrument, or means of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. And ſo (me thinks) this learned and judicious Author hath here competently evinced, that the Sacraments may be, not ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by themſelves, but as accompanied with the Word, and as being after a ſort viſible words, holding out that to the eye, which the Word doth to the ear, and ſetting forth both Law and Goſpel to thoſe that underſtand the meaning of them. Some one or other particular there is beſides, wherein this Author is apt to meet with either Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, or Diſſenters: but as he is not unfurniſhed with grounds and reaſons to ſupport his opinion, ſo neither is he deſirous to impoſe upon any further then ſtrength of argument ſhall prevail. Some Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions he hath, but they are not heterogoneal to the ſubject in hand, and he was moreover enforced to them, as alſo to thoſe Diſputes in the Poſcript. Before Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Apologie came forth, hearing of his intentions, he expreſſed in a letter to me how much it troubled him, that he ſhould have him Antagoniſt, whom in diverſe respects he did ſo love and honour. And ſurely his Book of the Covenant doth ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently declare how unwilling he was to appear in a way of oppoſition to that worthy man.<note place="margin">

                  <p>THe overture which I gave in the Treatiſe of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, of my intentions by Gods aſſiſtance, to ſend forth the like of the Sacraments; not a few have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to turn into a promiſe, and have much ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me for performance. Which at laſt through many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and interruptions is now done, and expoſed to thy cenſure; which I expect to be different, according as it ſhall meet with men aforehand principled. If contention ſhall hereby unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily be encreaſed (as is too often ſeen in writings of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) my intentions will be altogether diſappointed, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations fruſtrated. I had never appeared on this ſubject, had I not ſeen the beſt of men in their thoughts much divided, if not perplext; and conceived ſome poſſible hopes of contributing ſomewhat towards ſatisfaction, and ſettlement. That great Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of the Lords Supper appointed of Jeſus Chriſt for a more near union; through mens miſtakes (and not from the nature of the Ordinance it ſelf) hath proved the greateſt diſtraction. How mighty contentions, and vehement diſputes have of a long time been held about Chriſts preſence? Firſt, with thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> party; afterward with the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches? When there is a full agreement of parties that Chriſt is there, (ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing an adminiſtration according to his inſtitution) the manner of his preſence hath occaſioned all the difference: When, if men would conſider, as they confeſſe; that it is a Sacrament about which all this contention is thus driven on, they could not but ſee, that Chriſts preſence <hi>with,</hi> or <hi>in,</hi> the <hi>Elements,</hi> can be no more then Sacramental, in which the ſign is ſtill put for the thing ſignified. The bead is the body, and the cup the blood of Chriſt, no otherwiſe then the rock in the wilderneſſe was Chriſt. In the explication of Sacramental ſigns, there can be expected no other then Sacramentall ſpeeches: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that great <hi>Lutheran</hi> Logician was much miſtaken, in char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the tranſgreſſion of his maxim upon <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> that <hi>the proper ſenſe of Scripture is ever to be held, unleſſe the contrary can be evidently proved,</hi> in their leaving of the letter in the words of
<pb facs="tcp:168215:9"/> the Supper, <hi>ſive</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as he ſpeaks: Taking it for granted, that no ſuch neceſſity can be ſhewen. When it is enough to evince the neceſſity of a trope, that the words are an expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a Sacramental ſign, We muſt not put this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at ſuch a diſtance from all others, as to make the whole here rigidly proper, and all others Sacramental. Words muſt be fitted to the nature of the ſubject. But to help himſelf out, he wiſely borrowes from <hi>Bellarmine</hi> an aſſertion, that <hi>Reaſons are not to be demanded of any that hold the proper ſenſe, why they keep to it.</hi> Both of them, it ſeems, deſpairing of giving any reaſon that is ſatisfying. But methinks he might bluſh in the uſe of the <hi>Simile,</hi> that he hath alſo borrowed to make his aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion good. This were, (ſay they) <hi>as if any ſhould ask of thoſe that are in a journey, why they hold the old beaten way; and why they go in at the door, and not at the window?</hi> When they, or either of them, can make it appear, that the old way of interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sacramental ſpeeches is, to underſtand them properly, without any Metonymie, then I ſhall ſay, that the letter here is not to be left, but in the ſtricteſt rigour to be followed: But till then I ſhall believe them to be both out of the way. And all Sacraments being appendants to promiſes, it will likewiſe follow, that Chriſts preſence with him that in faith takes theſe Elements, is no other then a preſence in Spirit. Where theſe things are happily accorded, and all ſcruple laid aſide, a new quarrel is raiſed about the ſubject of Sacraments. That they are inſtitutions of Chriſt, and gifts vouchſafed by him to his Church is acknowledged: But to whom they belong, and who of right can make his claim to them, is not determined; when yet the viſibility of the Ordinances, and truſt repoſed in man for diſpenſation of them, (whoſe ſight is more weak then to diſcern that which is inviſible) neceſſarily concludes that they belong to viſible Church-members, not in a ſelect way pickt out of other Churches, (which is a way that no Scripture-Saint ever trod) but in as great a latitude as the profeſſion of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith. In this, Scripture is ſo plain, that it is wonder, that ever it was made a controverſie. Either the <hi>Jew outwardly</hi> was miſ-nam'd, when the title of <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was given him; and a foul miſpriſion run upon, when a proſelyte was circumciſed, or a new convert in Scripture-way baptized; or elſe this muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be granted. So that, as to title, and right of claim, if
<pb facs="tcp:168215:9"/> Scriptures may judge, the Covenant-grant is clear. Yet as there are many that have their juſt right in Legacies, and inheritances, who are not judged meet for preſent fruition: It would be many a man's loſſe, even to ruine, to have that preſently put into his hands, which juſtly might be claimed as his own. So it fares in this great Ordinance of the Lords Supper, which all that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of, are to look upon, and improve as a memorial of Chriſts death; for which all are not in any poſſible capacity, as they are not for ſome other duties: And here in all reaſon, they that are to diſpenſe this Ordinance, are moſt concerned to diſtinguiſh. And if Regeneration be the mark by which they are to be ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is not like a Sea-boy, appointed for the Pilot's guide, flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the top of the water, but rather, as one hid in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, which neceſſarily involves both diſpenſer and receiver in inextricable difficulties and perplexities. And when moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that men free from ignorance, errour and ſcandal, though unregenerate, muſt have admiſſion; and all acknowledge, that ſuch (will we, nill we) will enter. If it be concluded, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regeneration is an undeniable and invincible barre to all poſſible benefit, and blank paper is alwayes ſealed whenſoever ſuch take it; it is not yet made known how it may be diſpenſed by thoſe in whoſe hands it is entruſted with any poſſible comfort. A great part of this work is, to render the way here more comfortably paſſable, in giving the doubting ſoul hopes, that yet ſees not concluding evidence, in his own thoughts, of a new birth: (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of which upon principles that they have taken in, ſadly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt themſelves in participation of this Ordinance) and withal, to put courage into the hands of the Miniſters of Chriſt, to preſſe the power of this ſoul-humbling Ordinance of God, on the hearts of intelligent hearers, competently inſtructed in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel principles, whom yet they may juſtly have in jealouſie not yet to have come up to this great and bleſſed work of a thorough change wrought, in the mean ſpace differing little or nothing from the common received opinion as to the qualifications of thoſe that are to be, or are not to be denyed admittance. Yet I thought not meet that they ſhould go alone, but to ſend out upon this occaſion into publick view, a juſt Tractate of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which occaſionally is grown into a bigger bulk then I ever intended. That which appeares clear to my ſight, I doubt not but will ſeem otherwiſe in the eyes of ſome others. And
<pb facs="tcp:168215:10"/> therefore I put it upon my account to meet, not onely with diſlike (as every one does that deals in works of this nature) but alſo with oppoſition. I heare indeed that as of old it hath been ſaid, that unregenerate men have no true right in the ſight of God, to any of his creatures; and that all ſuch poſſeſſors are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpers; ſo, alſo it is now maintained that all ſuch, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their viſible Church-intereſt, are without all right to any Church-priviledges. Though they make uſe of them, as unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate men do of the creatures, and by command from God muſt make uſe of them, ſo that their neglect of them is juſtly charged as their ſin, yet they are ſtill without any true right to them, or title in them. This I confeſſe with me is a ſtrange aſſertion. I ſhould thinke that thoſe immunities which Jeſus Chriſt (to whom all power is given in heaven, and in earth) of his good pleaſure, doth vouchſafe to men of meer viſible Church-intereſt, in order to bring them to an inviſible right and title, and which unregenerate men enjoy, in order to work them to a Regenerate ſtate, are their true ana proper right; as the immunities which the higheſt power grants to civil incorporations; in order to bring them to a further honour and luſtre, are their juſt inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. When <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded the congregation of <hi>Jacob</hi> a law, this is called their inheritance <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.4. By vertue of the grand charter from God himſelfe, who herein differenced them from all other nations. It is true, that the groſſe abuſe of civil immunities granted to incorporate bodies, may juſtly move the higheſt power to disfranchize them: but whileſt the grant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, the priviledge is theirs: and the like abuſes of Church-priviledges, may juſtly move Chriſt Jeſus, and hath moved him, to diſchurch a people, and take his Kingdome from among them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving his Candleſtick from them; but whileſt his Kingdome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, and their light by his long ſuffering-holds, their right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues. The Regenerate make a more bleſſed uſe, but the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate have an equal right. There was no difference in the right of Apoſtleſhip between <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> how great ſoever the difference was in their reſpective improvement of it. The bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren tree whileſt it hath a place in the Vineyard, is within the verge of the ſervants care, and hath right to be digged, and dung'd, as well as the fruitful. To draw towards an end, and not to hold thee longer from the work it ſelf; as to the whole that thou ſhalt finde here delivered, the great thing that I crave at thy hands is,
<pb facs="tcp:168215:10"/> that thoſe two great enemies to a right apprehenſion of truth, <hi>Prejudice</hi> and <hi>Reſpect of Perſons</hi> may be laid aſide, that ſo my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may gaine, (which otherwiſe they will be denyed) an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fent hearing: and that nothing may be charged as mine (upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſupppſed want of diſtinct explication) which I do not clearly own, and which men may have reaſon to believe that I ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime. For prevention of which, ſo far as may be in me, I have given in a liſt of <hi>Erratas,</hi> which I pray thee to correct before, or as thou readeſt, if it be not already done to thy hand, as in moſt CoppieS, I hope, care will be taken of thoſe that are more foule: many of which do not only deſtroy the ſenſe, which were more tolerable: but lead to a contrary ſenſe. Other ſmaller faults, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly literal or miſpointings, or ſuch miſtakes; in a word, where that which was intended is clearly obvious, I hope I need not entreat thy candour. As for any that ſhall pleaſe to appear againſt me (as in almoſt every part of the work I know, that I have ſome of one intereſt or other that are adverſaries) I only deſire that they deale with me, as I have made it my buſineſſe to deale with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Perſonal invectives, <hi>Sarcaſmes</hi> and Jeers, though upon the faireſt ſuppoſed advantage, falſifications, wreſtings of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, induſtrious concealment of the ſtrength of arguments may poſſibly cloud an adverſary, but ſhall never advance the glory of truth; which ſtands not in need either of mens paſſion, or frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulency, which will be found no better then his folly. And what name ſoever may be gained, where truth gaines nothing, let thoſe enjoy that look after it: I deſire not to be any ſhare in it. So far as I yet ſee (and I think I ſee much reaſon for it) I intend here to ſet down my ſtaffe, and to travel no further in this troubleſome way, reſolving not to change my purpoſe unleſſe I ſhall either be convinced by truth, and ſo ſhall manifeſt the change of my minde; or elſe ſee the truth in danger to ſuffer, which I do not yet ſee in any thing, which is publiſhed againſt me, and not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by me. And in ſuch caſe I ſhall endeavour to take that way that truth may be beſt cleared, and the Reader leaſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, which will be, as much as is poſſible, to examine adverſaries arguments, and decline perſonal concernments. The Lord grant, that all that is here ſpoke for truth, may be ſuccesful for thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual good! And if any thing, through miſtake, be let fall againſt it, that it may ſpeedily be diſcovered, that nothing here may be thy Spiritual detriment.</p>

In caſe we had a word in Scripture from the Pen of the Holy Ghoſt fitted to the thing it ſelf, and comprizing theſe ordinances, in that generality as the word Sacrament doth, in the common uſe of it, I ſhould then quit this name, and take to that. But ſeeing there is no ſuch word, And <hi>Tertullian</hi> the moſt ancient of all the Latine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, (whoſe works are extant) uſing it, as <hi>Voſſius</hi> obſerves, <hi>Theſ.</hi> 6. <hi>De Sacrament.</hi> and ſince his time in the ſucceſſive ages of the Church it is continued, and now generally received; it were too much affectation of ſingularity to recede from it; yet I would put this caution upon the uſe of it; <hi>That it muſt ſerve onely to denote the thing, that we treat about, and that no argument from the word, be drawn to hold out the nature of theſe Myſteries.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>But thoſe that upon this, and the like grounds, do freely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the uſe of the word, cannot ſo eaſily agree of the reaſon of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:168215:13"/> it; how it comes to paſſe, that theſe Ordinances came to have this term, or name put upon them; why Baptiſme and the Lords Supper ſhould be called by the name of Sacraments. There are onely three opinions, that I meet withall, that are worthy to be taken notice of; and theſe drawn from three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral acceptations of the word Sacrament, in prophane Authours.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The depoſiting of money by men ſtriving for Maſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, in Conſecrated places, (upon thoſe terms, that he that conquered ſhould take away his part; and he that was conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſhould leave his with the Prieſt) according to <hi>Varro</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Sacrament. They collected therefore, that the Sacrament ſignifies our depoſiting of our ſelves (as I may ſay) with God, or our yielding up of our ſelves to him. As they that ſtrive for maſtery, did leave for a pledge a ſumme of money, ſo we leave our ſelves as a pledge with God. But this uſe of the word Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, I ſuppoſe is more obſcure; and the analogy not ſo clear, and therefore Divines in ancient times, would ſcarce bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row this word from thence, ſo few underſtanding the alluſion, or the application of it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The oath which anciently Souldiers took, when they liſted themſelves to the Emperour; for faith and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, was called by the name of Sacrament. Therefore others judge it very probable, that theſe Ordinances are called Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; in that in them every Chriſtian Souldier doth tye him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his Captain Chriſt Jeſus. This is far more probable, for three Reaſons. 1. The uſe of the word in this ſenſe, was more common and received, and therefore more apt to give occaſion to the like uſe of it in theſe Sacred Ordinances. 2. The appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is more clear, ſeeing our Sacraments (as God willing ſhall be ſhewn) are engagements. 3. Heathen Writers make ſuch alluſion;<note n="d" place="margin">Deo oporte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat &amp; nos ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare &amp; milites <hi>Caeſar.</hi>

                        <hi>It behoves us</hi> (ſaith one of them) <hi>to ſwear to God, and Souldiers to Caeſar.</hi> And the Fathers uſed the word Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with this alluſion, as <hi>Voſſius</hi> out of <hi>Tertullian</hi> quotes two paſſages,<note n="e" place="margin">Vocati ſumus ad militiam Dei vivi jam tunc, cum in Sacramenti verba reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimus.</note>

                        <hi>That he may be diſbanded and ſhut out from the bleſſings of the Sacraments, never more to return into the tents of the Church.</hi> To which may be added a third quoted by <hi>Bellarmine; The Devil imitates the very things of Divine Sacraments, in idol-Myſteries, he waſhes ſome, and ſignes other of his Souldiers in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:168215:13"/> their foreheads.</hi> And <hi>Auſtine</hi> in his Preface to the 181 Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>De tempore</hi> ſaith,<note n="g" place="margin">Notum eſt dilectiſſimi quod bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficia temporalia a temporalibus Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis accepturi, prius Sacramentis militaribus obligantur &amp; Dominis ſuis fidem ſe ſervaturos profitentur.

                        <hi>It is known, Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the Souldiers being to receive temporal rewards from their temporal Maſters, do first tye themſelves with military Sacraments, and profeſſe faithful ſervice to their Lords. How much more ſhould thoſe that war under an Eternal King, and are to receive rewards from him, bind themſelves with heavenly Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and publickly profeſſe that faith where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may pleaſe him.</hi> In this <hi>Rivet</hi> reſts ſatisfied, as appears in his <hi>Cathol.

                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, There being ſo great affinity between <hi>Mystery</hi> among the Greeks, and <hi>Sacrament</hi> among the Latines, <hi>Mystery</hi> ſignifying that which is ſecret of any kind whether ſacred or prophane, of which there are many inſtances given; and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> ſignifying that which is made ſacred, or conſecrate, words ſeldome long holding their ſignification; Myſtery began to be taken more ſtrictly for holy ſecrets; and ſo Sacraments for Sacred ſecrets; afterwards the word <hi>Myſtery</hi> and with it <hi>Sacrament</hi> began to be uſed for ſacred things held forth in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſignes. The viſion of the ſeven Candleſticks ſetting out ſeven Churches, are called <hi>Myſteries,</hi> Revel. 1.20. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction in marriage of man and wife, ſetting forth the union between Chriſt and his Church, is called a <hi>Myſtery,</hi> Epheſ. 5.32. And when Divines found no word in Scripture, to ſet out theſe Ordinances of the Old and New Teſtament, Circumciſion, Paſſeover, Baptiſme, the Lords Supper, they gave them the name of <hi>Sacraments,</hi> further reſtraining their ſignification to holy ſecrets, held forth in outward ſignes, and ſealing ſpiritual grace to us.

And as they began to borrow rites from the Jews in Baptiſme, they called them by the name of Sacraments. Their Ointments and Chriſmes (yea the Croſſe it ſelf, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> makes no more then a ceremony in Sacraments) are called by the name of Sacraments. But theſe acceptations of the word are grown obſolete, and are ſo far from holding out the nature of thoſe Ordinances, which now paſſe under the name of Sacraments, that men cannot be brought to any miſtake in reading of them. The word <hi>Sacrament</hi> is ordinarily now ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in that ſenſe as <hi>Auſtine</hi> doth define it. An outward viſible ſign of an inward ſpiritual grace, that is a ſign inſtituted of God to hold out and ſeal ſaving grace to the ſoul, as afterward (God willing) may be more largely held forth. Now in every Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of this nature, there is, firſt, an outward ſign open to the ſenſes; ſecondly, there is a ſpiritual grace; thirdly, an order eſtabliſhed and declared between the ſign and the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and ſome of theſe ſtill give the denomination. <hi>Sometimes</hi> the outward ſign is taken for the Sacrament, and therefore the diſtinction is ordinary between <hi>Sacramentum</hi> and <hi>rem Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti.</hi> And it can be no more than a bare ſign, when the thing ſignified is apart conſidered and put in oppoſition to it. <hi>Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times</hi> the outward ſign and the thing ſignified, conſidered joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are called by the name of a Sacrament, and this <hi>Gerard</hi> ſayes is the moſt proper and moſt uſual acceptation. <hi>Sometimes</hi> the order or analogy that is betwixt the ſign and the thing ſignified, is called by the name of Sacrament; and therefore <hi>Keckerman</hi> defines a Sacrament to be<note n="m" place="margin">Sacramentum eſt ordo ſanctus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rem externam in ſenſus incurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, et viſus imprimis objectum tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

This therefore we may well judge to be the moſt proper acceptation of it. <hi>Keckerman</hi> therefore as ſoon as he had defined a Sacrament, as before, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently tells us, that<note n="n" place="margin">Sacramenti vox per ſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creta eſt, et ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificat rem ſive ſubjectum, cum modo rei, id eſt, cum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l tione rei ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditâ: interim tamen poteſt etiam uſurpari pro Ipſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracto, id eſt, pro relatione ut nos quidem in definitione uſurpavimus.</note> 
                        <hi>the word of it ſelf is a concrete, and ſignifies the thing or ſubject with the manner of it, that is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>with the relation added to it: yet it may be taken for the abſtract, that is, for the relation as</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we have put into the definition.</hi> But ſeeing the word of it ſelf, by our Authors confeſſion, is no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract, but a concrete, and the Apoſtle in his definition doth ſo conſider it, we have juſt reaſon in that ſenſe to ſpeak to it; and ſo in this whole Treatiſe I ſhall take it. And before I proceed in any further Enquiry, the Reader may juſtly expect ſuch a defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition as may ſerve as a thred through the whole Diſcourſe. But my intention being to enquire ſomething into the nature of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments in mans integrity, (that ſo the Work may anſwer the Title) <hi>A Treatiſe of the Sacraments,</hi> but mainly to inſiſt on thoſe that are appointed by God for his people in the Covenant of Grace, I am neceſſitated to put off the enquiry after ſuch a definition that may give ſatisfaction, till I come to that which I intend as my principal Subject. Yet that by the way he may not be wholly left unſatisfied, I ſhall here offer ſuch a definition that may comprehend all Sacraments as well in the Covenant of Works, as in the Covenant of Grace; intreating him to forbear any ſtrict enquiry into the reaſons of it, untill he come into the full Body of the Diſcourſe, where by the definition, which (God willing) ſhall be given of Sacraments in the Covenant of Grace, and from Scripture at large confirmed, he may eaſily judge of the definition of Sacraments in general, and thus I ſuppoſe it may be held out. A Sacrament is a ſign inſtituted of God for the uſe of his people in Covenant, to ſignifie and ſeal his Promiſes upon Terms and Propoſitions by himſelf preſcribed and appointed.</p>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:168215:16"/> Chap. 3. pag. 10. and ſo muſt this tree of life in caſe it have the nature of a Sacrament be a Sacrament of preſervation, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. And ſo <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> his foundation, on which he builds, that man in integrity needed no Sacrament, becauſe the whole need not the Phyſician, but thoſe that are ſick, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.12. is anſwered.

                           <hi>Some are actually ſick ſo are all men</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the ſtate of ſin; ſome are in poſſibility or danger of ſickneſſe, having a principle in them capable of it, either more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate or remote;</hi> ſo it was with man in integrity, he needed Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick for prevention, not for cure; to keep him in the ſtate in which he ſtood that he might not fall: not to recover him out of evill being fallen.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>The Covenant of works paſſing between God and man in an immediate way without any reference had to Chriſt,</hi> (as hath been largely ſhewn, and objections anſwered, Treatiſe of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, pag. 13. &amp;c.) the Sacraments annexed muſt needs be <hi>without reference to Chriſt likewiſe:</hi> I know many learned men ſuppoſe that Chriſt was a Mediatour between God and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and between God and man in his integrity: and theſe will have the tree of life, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.9. to be a ſymbole of Chriſt, as the bread and wine in the Lords ſupper, which indeed neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes upon that ſuppoſition: but that falling all the ſuppoſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of ſign and thing ſignified between the tree of life and Chriſt falls with it. That opinion of theirs referring the tree of life to Chriſt they ſuppoſe hath ſtrength from that ſpeech of Chriſt to the Church of <hi>Epheſus; To him that overcometh I will give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God,</hi> Revel. 2.7. which all Interpreters refer to Chriſt, ſeeing there is no life but in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.12. <hi>He that hath the Son hath life, he that hath not the Son hath not life.</hi> As alſo from <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.2. ſpeaking of the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>In the midſt of the ſtreet of it and of either ſide of the river was the tree of life, &amp;c.</hi> which can be no other but that Sun of righteouſneſs with healing in his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:168215:16"/> wings, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2. But neither of theſe places ſerve their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, nor is the argument drawn from thence at all cogent. The tree of life in the literal Paradiſe was a ſymbole of immortality, and everlaſting bliſſe, which man perſiſting in obedience ſhould have enjoyed, whether on earth or in heaven, ſtill remained in Gods choyce to determine; In the ſtate of ſin this could not be without Chriſt, and every ſymbole of it, therefore in this ſtate leads to Chriſt. But it followes not that it was ſo in mans ſtate of integrity. He ſhould then have enjoyed it, by ah immediate gift from God, &amp; not through Chriſt, whoſe whole work was not to keep man in <hi>ſtatu quo,</hi> as before ſin, but to recover from ſin into which he was fallen. In thoſe places of the <hi>Revelation</hi> there is (after the manner of the viſions of that book) an allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion borrowed from that tree in Paradiſe, which as <hi>Ravanellus</hi> obſerves was a type of immortality. This tree aſſured man of it in Paradiſe on tearms of bedience. In the ſtate of ſin the ſame is to be had through Chriſt on Goſpel tearms and conditions. In caſe any will aſſign the work of mans ſupport in any tranſcendent way to the ſecond perſon in the Trinity, who is ſaid to uphold all things by the word of his power, without any reference to his wotk of mediation, as to be incarnate: as I dare not aſſert it, ſo I will not contend about it. But in this I am confident the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of our Sacraments is Chriſt incarnate, and all the benefits of them is through and by chriſt, but ſo it was not in the Sacraments in Paradiſe.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>The life promiſed in the Covenant of works to man in caſe of obedience, was not barely a prorogation of his being or preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from diſſolution to an immortality in nature.</hi> This he might have enjoyed and have continued for ever perfectly wretched, and ſo the performance of the promiſe ſhould have been a curſe, and no bleſſing. As it was ſaid by our Saviour of <hi>Judas</hi> upon his great ſin of betraying Chriſt, <hi>It had been good for that man that he had never been born,</hi> Matth. 26.24. So it might have been ſaid of <hi>Adam,</hi> though he had never ſinned it had been good for him that he had never been created, and therefore thoſe that ſee no more towards bliſs, in this promiſe of life then a perpetuation in being, according to the vulgar acceptation of it, underſtand that ſpeech of God concerning our firſt Parents, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.22. <hi>And now leſt he put forth his hand, and take alſo of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever,</hi> to be a ſpeech of mercy to keep man from
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:168215:17"/> an immortality of miſery: and according to that opinion the curſe threatened for tranſgreſſion had been ſuffered, and the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing affixt to obedience at once enjoyed, which is the greateſt of paradoxes; life then (as elſewhere I have ſhewed) in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe compriſes true bleſſednes, a fruition of all that ſerves to make happy, and a freedom from all that tends to miſery, ſo that man lived no longer then he ſtood and ſinned not; death in its meaſure immediately ſeized, though the full execution in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to ſome is delayed, to others the whole reverſd.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>The names given to theſe reſpective trees muſt not be accounted vain</hi> (as it fares many times with names given by men) <hi>ſeeing the Spirit of God hath affixed theſe names to them.</hi> But ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing muſt be found in the trees, or from God by the trees, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the names that they carry: When God gave <hi>Abram</hi> the name of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>a father of multitudes,</hi> Gen. 17.5. the event we find anſwered, how improbable ſoever (when the name was given him) it appeared; <hi>Therfore</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ſprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, ſo many as the ſtarres of the skie in multitude, and as the ſand which is by the ſea-ſhore innumerable,</hi> Heb. 11.12. <hi>Solomon</hi> was called <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.25. which ſignifies <hi>beloved of the Lord,</hi> and was not barely ſo named, but indeed beloved, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13.26. <hi>Among many Nations there was no King like him who was beloved of his God.</hi> The name of that wonderfull birth, <hi>Eſay</hi> 7.14. was <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel,</hi> which the Spirit of God hath interpreted, <hi>God with us, Matth.</hi> 1.23. he was ſo named, and this he did effect, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.29. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them.</hi> Our firſt Parents therefore were to expect ſome way both life and knowledge from theſe trees: They had their names in reality, and not by way of fiction, or fancy given to them.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, <hi>This tree of life with that other of the knowledge of good and evil had not any natural power or innate efficacious vigor, to anſwer their names in giving life by the taſte, or eating of them,</hi> as Satan bore the woman in hand concerning the one of them. This I know hath been the opinion of ſome, which falſe ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath occaſioned an hot and curious diſpute, whether this tree ſhould have given man life totally and wholly to a full im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality? or whether it ſhould have preſerved his life to ſome definite time of ſome thouſands of years? But the contrary is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:168215:17"/> plain both by reaſon and experience, and ſo the ground of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute is taken away.</p>
                        <p>This appears, firſt by reaſon.<note n="d" place="margin">Arbores enim infra homines ſunt, imo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fra an malia, quia ne ſenſus quidem capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces fuere ergo propter aliud &amp; ex inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one, adeoque Sacrameenta.</note> 
                           <hi>Trees</hi> (as <hi>Chamier</hi> well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves) <hi>are below men, yea, below other creatures that were made for the uſe of man, being capable of a vegetative life,</hi> onely for growth, but not of ſenſe, and ſo could not confer on man by any power from themſelves either life or knowledge. Some that ſtickle for this opinion ſee the force of this reaſon, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore yeeld that it is above them to produce any ſuch effect di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly. But indirectly they ſay there may be ſuch an efficacy; Meates that are ſingularly ſuitable to nature have their work, in a direct way on the animal ſpirits for a life of nature, and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly upon the organs of the inward ſenſes.

                        <p>As the truth of this appears in reaſon, ſo alſo by experience, in that tree forbidden; when <hi>Eve</hi> liſtened to Satan and did eat of it (and her husband by her ſollicitation) knowledge was not gained but loſt, which mankind ſadly knowes; For that ſpeech of the Lord before mentioned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.22, 23, 24. <hi>And the Lord God ſaid, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil.

If we were able to make it good that they were phyſical cauſes of life and knowledge, then we muſt diſclaime their Sacramental uſe; but ſeeing that cannot appear, and the contrary is evident; This other muſt be aſſerted, It may eaſily be made out that the tree of life was a Sacramen.

                           <hi>And as often as he ate of it, or had his eye upon it</hi> (as <hi>Calvin</hi> well obſerves) <hi>he was to remember from whom he received life and bliſſe, and by whom he was preſerved and upheld, that he had no principle of life and bliſſe in himſelf, but as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it from God, ſo by his favour and free Grace it was continued:</hi> And to mind himſelf of his duty on what tearms he ſtood with God, and upon what condition his life and bliſſe was continued: whileſt he ſinned not he muſt not dye, as long as obedience laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he muſt enjoy a life in happineſs. Others add that it ſhadowed out Chriſt, by whom both he and the Angels ſtood in happineſſe: but I have already ſpoke my thoughts to that particular. But how to bring that other tree of the knowledge of good and evil ſo aptly to hold out the nature and uſe of a Sacrament, is not ſo eaſie: and I find many Interpreters aſſerting it, but not any that I can meet with demonſtrating it. And it muſt be confeſt that this Sacrament did herein differ from all other Sacraments. Thoſe did conſiſt in their uſe; This in mans abſtinence from it. In this it is ſaid thou, ſhalt not eat: In the Paſſeover and the Lords Supper the communitants muſt eat. But God hath it in his power to inſtitute Sacraments according to pleaſure, by way of prohibition, as well as by way of injunction. In other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments in the due uſe, men attain to the good that is promiſed: In this by abſtinence man ſhould have avoyded the evil threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. In eating of the tree of life, while man perſiſted in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he was aſſured of life, that was a ſeal and pledge of it. And while he abſtained from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he had like aſſurance of freedom from death. This alone was a negative Sacrament, and it was proper to this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament onely, that not the fruition of good, but the avoydance of evil was the thing ſignified. The reaſon of the name is the enquiry of many why it was called the tree of the knowledge of good and evil? Some that would deny it to be any Sacrament, ſay that it had the name from the natural effect that it was apt to produce, being created to quicken or ripen man in the uſe of his reaſon, conceiving that our firſt Parents were created weak in knowledge, of an infant underſtanding: And to know good and evil (that is, chooſe the good, and refuſe the evil) in the Hebrew phraſe ſetting out the uſe of reaſon, as, <hi>Eſay</hi> 7.16. Before the child ſhall know to refuſe the evil, and chooſe the good: They ſay
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:168215:19"/> this tree was to work them to this maturity in knowledge. How falſe this is of our firſt Parents weakneſſe in knowledge is clear by the names that man gave to all creatures upon ſight, as he had dominion over them, ſo he underſtood the nature of them, as alſo in that ſpeech that he uttered concerning <hi>Eve,</hi> when the Lord upon her creation brought her to him to give her in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. The Wiſe man ſayes that God made man upright, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.29. And this uprightnes comprizes mans whole confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to God in all in which his image doth conſiſt, which was as the Apoſtle tells us, in knowledge, as in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. To avoid ſuſpition of inclination to any ſuch opinion, ſome when they ſpeak of mans firſt eſtate, purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avoid the word innocency, and chooſe to uſe the word inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity. And how unapt the fruit of a tree could poſſibly be in nature to produce any ſuch effect, that which was ſpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the tree of life being applyed hither may demonſtrate. And whence this opinion came but from the Devil I cannot tell, who told our mother <hi>Eve,</hi> that God did know that in the day that they eat thereof their eyes ſhould be opened, and they ſhould be like unto gods, knowing both good and evil, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.5. He was the firſt that vented it, and ſhe was the firſt that believed it; when ſhe ſaw that the tree was good for food and pleaſant to the eye, and a tree to be deſired to make one wiſe; ſhe did take and eat thereof, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.6. The taſte it ſeems was the taking quality; the other trees were good for food, and doubtleſs lovely to the eye, but this alone anſwerable to the name with the Devils com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon it was a tree to be deſired for this end, but ſhe found the contrary; light was not only not encreaſed, but put out, ſo that man now is a beaſt by his own knowledge; others therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that it had name, not from any ſuch effect that in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it was apt to produce, but by reaſon of the event that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and upon the taſte of it muſt of neceſſity follow; now they experimentally know the good which they had by ſin loſt, and the evil which they had incurred.<note n="k" place="margin">Quemad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modum qui medicus eſt theoretice vim morbi &amp; ſani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis bonum cognoſcit, in morbum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſus amiſſa ſanitate nova quadam rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one, per expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rientiam bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num ſanitatis, &amp; malum morbi cognoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit.</note>

It cannot be imagined, how they ſhould reach ſuch a fancy, but that the poſterity of <hi>Noah,</hi> had ſcattered ſome Divine light of this tradition among them. Their gods, who were but men, and ſome of them the worſt of men, bringing all wickedneſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown by their example, being ſuppoſed to have an immortal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, muſt have ſome way or means to come up to immortality.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:168215:21"/> evil; dreaming of a Phyſical operation, and not underſtanding any Sacramental efficacy: God alſo inſtructed his people in the uſe of ſacrifices, which we know was with his people from the beginning; and I cannot believe with ſome <hi>Jeſuits</hi> that this was of the dictates of nature: which (as they ſay) led them without any revelation, to the uſe of ſacrifices: For in what ſenſe ſoever we take ſacrifices, Nature could never teach man to give it unto God. If we take it more largely, for a gift tendred, reaſon would tell, that the Divine Majeſtie ſtands in no need of it: And in caſe we underſtand it more ſtrictly, and make the deſtruction of that which is offered eſſentiall to a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: how could this in reaſon enter into any mans thoughts; that when a man had ſinned, a beaſt muſt dye? And that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. doth fully contradict it, <hi>Abell offered by faith,</hi> and faith is not of nature, but above it. This then was a worſhip of God by inſtitution, not commanded in the firſt, but ſecond Commandment: and this Satan is ready to follow. As there was ſcarce a Nation, as the Orator obſerved, but worſhipped a god: ſo there is ſcarce a Nation, that did not ſacrifice to thoſe gods: and the Apoſtle gives us to underſtand, what thoſe gods were: <hi>The things that the Gentiles offer in ſacrifice, they offer to Devils, and not to God,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. It is his worſhip, and he teacheth his the way of it.

And in caſe we take it, for a meer fiction: (which is his judgement upon it) his art is no leſſe obſervable to diſcredit, as farre as in him lyes, the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of Scriptures: When this miracle of <hi>Jonahs</hi> ſhall be Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and publiſhed in the world, <hi>Arions</hi> fable ſhall be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that like faith may be yeelded to either of both. See Mr. <hi>Burges Spiritual Refining,</hi> Pag. 131, 132. Where this thing in many particulars is enlarged. And the more high the wayes of Religion are raiſed of God in a Spiritual way, the more eaſie it is for Satan, who is a ſpirit, to delude. The Spirit is the great Goſpel-promiſe, to be poured out on all fleſh; that is, on men of all ſorts, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28. God will be ſerved in types and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes no longer, but in Spirit, and truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.23. When the <hi>Jewes</hi> gloried of Circumciſion, as that which did denominate them a people of God, and diſtinguiſhed them from all other Nations: and urged the neceſſity of it to ſalvation: the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells us, that they <hi>are the Circumciſion, that worſhip God in Spirit,</hi> Phil. 3.3. Satan now on the other hand, can take the hint, and heighten his way in a deſtructive manner to Goſpel wayes. All outward Ordinances ſhall now be decryed as formes, and beggarly rudiments: and with Circumciſion in the letter laid aſide, though they be Ordinances of the Spirit it ſelf; in which the Spirit expreſſes its power and efficacy. 1. The written Word, which was dictated by the Spirit, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. (is the ſword of the Spirit, by which it exerciſes his power on the ſoul) muſt be laid aſide as a dead letter, and over carnal. The Miniſters of the Word, that great gift from the Fathers right hand, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. ſet over the flocks by the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. on this pretence are to be caſt off with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi> taking too much upon them, when all the Congregation is holy: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding for a real confutation, when this Spirit was firſt given in glory, it came upon the heads of his Miniſters, in forme of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:168215:22"/> tongues, fiery, cloven, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.3. To let all know (is that great appearance that was there) (that their tongues are ſanctified of God, to Preach the Word in power and life to all Nations. And as the gifts of the Spirit encreaſed; ſo the Miniſters of the Spirit were multiplyed; and that very title and name given <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.6. And the mind of Jeſus Chriſt made known, that theſe in a peculiar order, diſtinct from other men; are ſet apart to preach the Goſpel, as the Prieſts under the Law in a peculiar order were to wait at the Altar, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.13, 14. Upon the ſame pretence, Sacraments muſt be laid aſide; the Baptiſme of the Spirit is pleaded, for the overthrow of the Baptiſme of water: Though the Apoſtle that firſt ſpake by the Spirit after it was given in glory, doth argue the clean contrary, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.47. <hi>Who can forbid water, that theſe ſhould not be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, which have received the holy Ghoſt as well as we?</hi> They that have the Spirit, will be raiſed in zeal for the honour, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of every Ordinance of God by the Spirit: the more ſpiritual men are, the more care they will take to advance the Word, the Miniſters of the Word, Sabbaths, Sacraments. Let us then obſerve his imitations his falſifications: He vents do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of his own, ſets up wayes of his own, that carry a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of Gods wayes: And <hi>ſimilitude,</hi> is <hi>mater erroris:</hi> we ſhall never heed them, as long as we know they are the Devils: but when he transformes himſelf into an Angel of light, and puts the ſtamp of God upon his own coyn, we muſt not be ignorant of his ſleights; but to have our ſenſes exerciſed, to diſcern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween good and evill.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:168215:23"/> time that God entered Covenant with him, and his ſeed: which <hi>Suarez,</hi> ſaith, according to the common account, doth end at the giving of the Law by <hi>Moſes,</hi> when the old Law began: yet Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion (which was in uſe long before the Law) continuing the ſame under the Law; he determines the law of nature at that time, when Circuciſion began.

The firſt juncture of time, hath uſually been known by the time of the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The ſecond, the time of the Old. And the laſt, the time of the New Covenant. Why the firſt of theſe ſhould bear the name of the Law of nature, I can read of none that have given ſatisfaction: The phraſe ſhould ſeem to imply, that then men had no more light, then that of nature, for their guide in the wayes of God. But this is evidently falſe: God did not then begin by way of ſupernatural revelation, to ſpeak to men in the world. <hi>Suarez</hi> in <hi>tertiam partem Thomae,</hi> Tom. 3. Diſput. 4.

Concerning this ſpace of time; whatſoever is the period of it, much enquiry is made, whether there were any Sacraments at all inſtituted of God, and enjoyed by his people on earth? Concerning which, I ſhall deliver my thoughts in ſeveral pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">God had his Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in that jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of time.</note>Firſt, <hi>That God had his Church and People, with a way of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip pleaſing to, and accepted by himſelf in thoſe times.</hi> This evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appears out of the Hiſtory: <hi>Abell, Henoch, Noah, Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedeck</hi> (who without all doubt lived in thoſe times; and <hi>Job</hi> as it is commonly received) ſpake ſo much, and the Apoſtles Comment, or obſervation of thoſe times, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. makes it more evident: <hi>Abell offered to God a more excellent gift then Cain, and obtained witneſſe that he was righteous,</hi> Heb. 11.4. They both made Viſible profeſſion of the ſame God, and both ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to God: and God put a difference between their gifts. An embleme of the Church in all ſucceeding ages, which is that great houſe, where are veſſels of honour, and diſhonour. <hi>By faith Henoch was tranſlated, that he ſhould not ſee death: and was not found, becauſe God had tranſlated him: for before his tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:168215:23"/> he had this teſtimony, that he pleaſed God,</hi> Heb. 11.5. and as he affirms, that it was by faith that be was thus tranſlated: ſo he proves it he had this teſtimony, that he pleaſed God. <hi>But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith it is impoſſiblc to pleaſe him,</hi> verſ, 6. <hi>Noah became heir of the righteouſneſſe by faith,</hi> verſ. 7. God had his worſhip then, as appears by <hi>Abells,</hi> and <hi>Noahs</hi> ſacrifice: and in <hi>Melchizedeks</hi> function, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.18. <hi>Who was a Prieſt of the moſt high God, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from among men, and ordained for men, in things appertaining to God, that he might both offer gifts and ſacrifices,</hi> Heb. 5.1. The Woman had all that time her ſeed, and the Serpent his, who kept up their mutuall enmity: as <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Abell, Noah,</hi> and the men of the world, <hi>Lot,</hi> and the men of <hi>Sodom</hi> do give wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: God had a people of Covenant-holineſs; thoſe <hi>Sons of God that ſaw thc daughters of men that they were fair, and took of them wives of all which they choſe,</hi> Gen. 6.1. He had a people truly holy: <hi>Lot</hi> had that Epithete of <hi>juſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. the name of <hi>a righteous man: Noah</hi> had that witneſs of God, that <hi>he ſaw him righteous,</hi> Gen. 7.1. and of <hi>Abel</hi> the Apoſtle ſaitb, that his <hi>works were righteous.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>We read not of any Sacrament appointed of God for theſe times, nor of any Divine Ordinance or ſign that comes up to the nature of a Sacrament.</hi> Thoſe that may be inſtanced in, with moſt colour are, 1. That of ſacrifice, both before, and after the floud; and that of the Rain-bow immediately upon the floud. That of ſacrifice comes more near up to the nature of a Sacrament, then that of the Bowe; But how both come ſhort of the nature of a Sacrament, in the ſenſe generally received, and now to be ſpoken to, I ſhall God willing in a more fit place make known.</p>

                        <hi>If there were any Sacraments in thoſe dayes appointed of God, for his people in Covenant, they muſt be of the ſame nature, as to the ſubſtance of them, and thing ſignified by them, with thoſe under the Law, and now in the dayes of the Goſpel.</hi> There was one common ſalvation, ours and theirs; one and the ſame Saviour, theirs and ours; we and they were under the ſame promiſes; Their Sacraments then muſt ſeal theſe promiſes. <hi>Noah</hi> was an heir of righteouſneſs of faith: Theſe ſuppoſed Sacraments could then ſigne and ſeal no other thing then that righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

                        <hi>becauſe we read of no Sacarments in thoſe dayes, to conclude, that there was none then appointed or in uſe: yet we may conclude that it is an high preſumption in any in this laſt age of the world to undertake to aſſert any Sacraments in thoſe times.</hi> This were indeed contrary to that which the Apoſtle warns, <hi>to preſume above that which was written,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.6. Where Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſilent, how dare we ſpeak? Scripture ſilence affords an argument of far greater probability for the negative, that in thoſe times there was no Sacrament in uſe, then all the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary conceits which men can invent or find. For the affirmative, that there were Sacraments then appointed: The old <hi>Rabbines</hi> had their traditions, concerning Gods tranſactions with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in that age. <hi>Weemſe</hi> in his Divine exercitations, <hi>Exer.</hi> 16. pag. 61. tells us, that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſay, that before the Law was written, God gave to <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeven Precepts, which he delivered by tradition to his poſterity after him. Theſe they call the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of their fathers which he there reckons up; but not any one concerning Sacraments. It is then ſure a vain labour for us at ſuch a diſtance, to have any thoughts of finding them out. Many <hi>Jeſuites</hi> beſtirre their wits, to conclude Sacraments in thoſe times. To ſave labour of further ſearch, for that which is of no greater neceſſity: the Reader may find much of what they have ſaid, in <hi>Chamier, de Sacramentis in genere, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. which Chapter he entitles, <hi>De Sacramentis in lege naturae: Suavez</hi> will by all means conclude, that there was then ſome Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament for the remedy of Original ſin, grounding himſelf on this which he puts into his margin, Pag. 40. Colume 2.<note n="b" place="margin">Divinae pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntiae eſt omni aetati providere.</note> 
                        <hi>That Divine providence is to take care of all ages;</hi> taking it fot granted, that providence is defective: if a ſtanding Sacrament in any age of the Church be wanting, and that there is no way in Divine providence to ſave an infant from Original ſin, but the actual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of a Sacramental ſign. Election cannot obtain it, nor Regeneration, nor Juſtification by the Spirit and blood of Chriſt effect it, without a Sacrament to make application of it. The <hi>Jeſuit</hi> might know, (and if Divines on our part might be heard, they would make known,) that Sacraments are not the remedy againſt Original ſin, but Chriſt, and the righteouſneſs of faith in Chriſt, which is the thing ſignified, and ſealed in the Sacrament: and the people of God enjoying means in thoſe times to attaine this righteouſneſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7. they were not without a remedy:
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:168215:24"/> Himſelf ingenuouſly confeſſes there is nothing in Scripture, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective to thoſe times, nor in tradition, of any ſuch Sacramental remedy; nor do any of the Fathers (as he ſaith) mention it, before <hi>Auſtin.</hi> And <hi>Auſtin</hi> (as he alſo acknowledges) ſpeaks of it doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, &amp; what he ſpeaks by way of conjecture, is not conſiſtent (as he obſerves) with his own doctrine elſewhere: In which the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of that Father is farre to be preferred before the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it; who concludes there was ſuch a Sacramental remedy though not inſtituted of God, but left to the Parents liberty to make uſe of ſome one, according to their own will, when this aſſertion of his is as inconſiſtent with his own doctrine as <hi>Auſtins</hi> can be; &amp; that upon a manifold account, as might be ſhewen. 1. He ſcarce knowes how to make it out, that Circumciſion was any remedy at all againſt Original ſin: ſeeing that Sacrament did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre grace by the work done, but by the merit, or diſpoſition of the doer; which is not found in infants. 2. He himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, that many infants dye in their mothers wombe; and yet have no remedy provided, either in the law of nature, or the old Law, or Law of grace; that is, neither before the Law, under the Law, or in Goſpel-times. 3. Water is not alwayes at hand (as he not abſurdly hints, though a Miniſter with them is ſcarce wanting, who ſet up Midwives for the work) and then the infant dyes remedileſſe: All this he thinks to help with a diſtinction.<note n="c" place="margin">Quanquam enim non de ſingulis in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulari pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videret, ut eis efficaciter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicaretur ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medium gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliter omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus proviſum: tamen quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum in ipſo eſt omnibus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videt.</note> 
                        <hi>Though</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>God hath not provided for each one in particular, that the remedy provided in general for all ſhould be applyed to them: yet he hath provided ſuch a remedy as far as in him lyes.</hi> But foreſeeing, that there would be ſome impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to hinder the application of this Sacramental remedy to ſome, this he permits. This is a ſpeech beſeeming a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> that God provided <hi>(quantum in ſe)</hi> a remedy, as though it had been above him to have avoyded theſe impediments. If the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> poſition muſt ſtand, that God is ſo tyed up with theſe limits, that he cannot take away Original ſin from infants, without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of ſomewhat that is ſenſible: He could have made ſuch proviſion as he forbade <hi>Sampſons</hi> mother, whileſt with child the drinking of wine, or ſtrong drink, or eating any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean thing, and that reſpective to the infant; becauſe he ſhould be a <hi>Nazarite</hi> to God from the wombe, to the day of his death, <hi>Judg.</hi> 13.7. ſo he could have enjoyned the mother to have taken that, which might through grace annext, have had that efficacy
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:168215:25"/> in the infant in the wombe, to take away Original ſin, as they conceive water hath on an infant new-born; yea, God is ſo far from doing, what in him lyes, reſpective to many infants, for proviſion of a remedy of this nature, that he orders that ſuch a ſuppoſed remedy, ſhall not be applyed. He with much ado, makes Circumciſion a remedy to deliver from Original ſin, Pag. 51. Yet God took order in his Law, that it ſhould not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred before the eighth day, and in that interim, between the birth, and the eighth day, it muſt needs be, that many dyed: and ſo by the law of Heaven, they were debarred of a remedy through grace provided.</p>
                     <p>But here he is oppoſed by divers of his own party, who hold that the faith of the Parent, is ſufficient to take away Original ſin from the infant: for which opinion he quotes <hi>Bonaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> Diſt. 1. Art. 2. Queſt. 2. <hi>Rich.</hi> art. 1. 5. 9. 1. &amp; 2. And <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mier,</hi> lib. 1. cap. 8. <hi>de Sacramentis in genere,</hi> Sect. 6. quotes alſo <hi>Vaſquez</hi> for the ſame opinion. Theſe place merit in the Parents faith to work to the juſtification of the infant; a merit not <hi>ex condiguo,</hi> but <hi>ex congruo:</hi> and for merit of this nature, a faith informed, void of Charity is ſufficient ſay they: Here our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor takes two exceptions againſt his friends. 1. ſaith he,<note n="d" place="margin">Sed hi authores in hoc, &amp; falſum ſupponunt, quia revera ad meritum de congruo non ſufficit fides informis, &amp; praeſertim ad merendam alteri gratiam &amp; ſanctitatem, &amp; praeterea non ſatis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicant vim, &amp; radicem hujus remedii; quia ut eſſet infallibile, quod neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium eſt, ut eſſet verum remedium, non ſatis erat meritum de congruo, quia non ſemper &amp; infallibiliter effectum ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, ſed neceſſaria erat divina promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio, &amp; hanc oportet oſtendere.</note> 
                        <hi>They argue from a falſe ground, for faith informed will not ſerve for this kind of merits eſpecially to merit grace for another.</hi> And ſecondly, <hi>they do not</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>ſufficiently ſet forth the force and efficacy of this remedy. To make it infallible (as it muſt be, if it be a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy) merit</hi> de congruo <hi>is not ſufficient, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it hath not alwayes infallibly its effects: But a Divine promiſe is neceſſary, and this promiſe (ſaith he) they ought to ſhew that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it.</hi> So that one part gives too much to the application of a ſenſible ſign to the infant, and the other over much to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Parent. <hi>Abuleuſis</hi> on <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. Queſt. 677. comes nearer to <hi>Bonaventure, Richard, Vaſquez,</hi> then to <hi>Suarez;</hi> hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that infants before Circumciſion were delivered from Original ſin, in that they were born of believers, not requiring (as <hi>Rivet</hi> obſerves, <hi>Exer.</hi> 88. in <hi>Geneſ.</hi>) any application of faith in the Parents to the infants in any Sacrament for that work, who
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:168215:25"/> might be dead before the Sacrament was adminiſtred to them. The ſame opinion is undertaken of late, in behalf of the infants of Chriſtians, to prove the infallibility of their ſalvation, whether dying before or after Baptiſme. I have enough on my hands al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and am not willing to launch out into this controverſie: I onely ſay. 1. I find infants of believers, not onely of the faith of the Elect, but of viſible profeſſion in Covenant; the Scripture is cleare for a Covenant in this latitude. 2. That ſalvation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Scripture wayes, is within the verge of the Covenant, and doth not go beyond it. The Scripture leaves men out of Covenant, in an hopeleſs condition. 3. As there is ſalvation for all ſorts and degrees of perſons of age in Covenant, but not to be extended to all of thoſe ſorts, and degrees, to reach every individual perſon; ſo in a parallell way we may think of infants; I know no text giving us univerſal aſſurance of their happineſs; in caſe there were, I ſuppoſe there were much mare cauſe for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, to begge of God their infants death, then with <hi>David</hi> in prayer to ſeek their life: there being full aſſurance of their happineſs dying, and ſo much fear of their condemnation, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to ſee the temptations to which in their growth they are ſubject. We find ſalvation entailed upon qualifications of grace, but not upon any age or period of life. 4. There is as much found in Scripture giving us hopes of the ſalvation of the infants of all in Covenant (as to their infant-ſtate) as to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of thoſe that are moſt exact in keeping of Covenant: As much is ſaid for the honour of infants of Parents of a faith barely dogmatical, as of the infants of thoſe that are actually in grace, and juſtified by faith; The infants of all ſuch (yea, of the worſt of ſuch) are <hi>the ſervants of God,</hi> Levit. 25.42. <hi>they are born unto God,</hi> Ezek. 16.20. they are <hi>the children of God,</hi> Ezek. 16.21. they are <hi>holy, Rom.</hi> 11.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. Either then we muſt carry it out to all the infants of the viſible Church, or elſe we cannot aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it to the infants of inviſible members. And therefore the Schoolemen afore mentioned, juſtly aſcribe as much to a faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, as to that which is formed; reſpective to the good of the iſſue of ſuch believers. 5. All that is ſpoken in Scripture of the bleſſedneſs of the ſeed of the righteous, may as fairly be extended to them through the whole courſe of their lives, as to the times of their infancy, promiſes being not put with any ſuch reſtraint, as to have an end when their infancy is expired. The
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:168215:26"/> moſt ample of promiſes which we find, is in <hi>Eſay</hi> 59.21. There it is promiſed, that <hi>the Spirit ſhall not depart out of the mouth of thy ſeed or thy ſeeds ſeed;</hi> but this rather belongs to them of years, then of an infant-condition. If it be ſaid, that many infants of the righteous perſevere not, but caſt off the ſeed of grace recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; I anſwer, the grace of perſeverance is neceſſarily required to make bleſſed, and bleſſedneſs is promiſed; we know tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral bleſſings are made over by promiſe to the ſeed of ſuch. <hi>His ſeed ſhall be mighty upon earth, wealth and riches ſhall be in his houſe,</hi> Pſal. 112.2, 3. Pſal. 37.25, 26. <hi>I have been young, and now am old, yet have I not ſeen the righteous forſaken, nor his ſeed beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging bread. He is ever merciful and lendeth, and his ſeed is bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> The oppoſition that is found between the letter of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, of this nature, and the event which the experience of every age obſerves, hath wrought a great conflict in mens ſpirits, how to reconcile them. And this hath been the reſult of all, that they are not to be underſtood without their due limits; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral have been put. I ſhall not ſtand to enter into the diſpute, onely I ſay, experience doth as much oppoſe the literal meaning of true bleſſedneſs to all the ſeed of the righteous, as of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral proſperity; one muſt therefore have its due limits, as well as the other. To wind up this whole diſcourſe concerning Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in that juncture of time: God then had his Church in which there was ſalvation. <hi>Henoch</hi> walked with God, and yet without faith it was impoſſible to pleaſe God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Noah</hi> was an heir of the righteouſneſs of faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7. a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in which the Apoſtle deſired to be found for ſalvation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. yet in all that juncture of time, there was no written Word, in which the ſucceeding ages have everlaſting life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.39. God had other wayes of diſcovery of himſelf to his people for life. So the Church might anſwerably be without Sacraments: howſoever we judge ſalvation to be thereby either conveyed or ſealed. God that tyes us to Ordinances, is himſelf free, and in what way he pleaſes, may communicate bliſſe, and give aſſurance of it. The likeſt conjecture that we can make of Gods ordering by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that in this juncture of time (from the fall to the time of <hi>Abrahams</hi> call) there ſhould be no Sacrament, nor any ſuch ſuppoſed remedy known, to acquit infants from Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin, is, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:168215:26"/> bound up by them: but as he ſaved without Sacraments before the floud, and after, to the time of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and infants under the Law dying before the eighth day; ſo he ſtill ſaves in the want, though not in the ſinful neglect, much leſſe in the contempt of theſe Ordinances.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the definition of a Sacrament.</head>
                     <p>THe next conſideration of Sacraments in mans fallen condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, from <hi>Abraham</hi> unto Chriſt, in the time of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the Old Covenant; In which thoſe known Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> and the <hi>Paſſeover</hi> were of force, and given in charge of God to his people: and together with thoſe Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments extraordinary (or ſuch as come near up to the nature of Sacraments,) The <hi>Cloud,</hi> the <hi>Red-Sea, Manna,</hi> and the <hi>Rock,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Sacraments under the old &amp; new Covenant of one and the ſame nature.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1, 2, 3, 4. But intending to ſpeak of Sacraments in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and there being no eſſential difference between the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, under the Old and New Covenant: One and the ſame definition, containing whatſoever is eſſential to a Sacrament in any of them, as many wayes might be made manifeſt. Their names are promiſcuouſly uſed, the cloud that <hi>Iſrael</hi> was under, and the ſea that they paſſed through, is called by the name of Baptiſme, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2. and ſo alſo is Circumciſion, <hi>Colloſ.</hi> 2.11, 12. The thing ſignified, and benefit received, is in every one the ſame. The Apoſtle comparing thoſe that did eat of <hi>Manna,</hi> and drank of the <hi>Rock</hi> in the Wilderneſs, with believers in Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-times, that partake of the Lords Supper ſaith, <hi>They all ate the ſame ſpiritual meat, and did all drink the ſame ſpiritual drink, for they drank of that ſpiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Chriſt,</hi> 1 Corrinthians. 10.3, 4. And, we may ſay the ſame of thoſe that did eat of the Paſſeover, As Chriſt was that bread that Manna did typifie, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.49.50. ſo it was he that was held out, and his death ſhewed forth in the Paſſeover, 1 <hi>Cor..</hi> 5.7. I ſhall therefore wave this different conſideration of them, and make it my buſineſſe to enquire what a Sacramen is, and to make diſcovery of the generall nature of it which in caſe out of Scripture I can reach, that will ſerve for a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:168215:27"/> bottome on which all that I intend to ſpeak may be grounded. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſpends a whole Chap. in enquiry, whether a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can properly be defined? quoting ſeverall Schoolmen for the negative; That it cannot be defined, <hi>becauſe a Sacrament is not one of it ſelf, but an aggregatum; one by accident,</hi> or at leaſt not <hi>ens reale, no real being;</hi> and thoſe things that are but one acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, or not really, are below a definition. He quotes others in the affirmative; Some, that it may be defined imperfectly; others, that it admits of a perfect definition. After a diſtinction laid down very little to the purpoſe, (one member of the diſtinction being by his own confeſſion not conſiderable by Divines) he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that a Sacrament morally conſidered (as it ought to be conſidered by Divines) may be defined, having a reall being, and according to its own way of being, it is one. Morall Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers define (ſaith he) a Kingdome, a City, a Family, though they be not one phyſically, but by aggregation; ſo do Divines de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine a Church, a Councell, or Sacrament, which are one in being no other way. <hi>Suarez</hi> agrees with him, <hi>Diſput.</hi> 1<hi rend="sup">a</hi>. <hi>de Sacramentis, Sect.</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">ta</hi>. which <hi>Whitaker, praelect. de Sacr. pag.</hi> 4. acknowledges to be true.<note place="margin">A Sacrament may be defined.</note> So that he obſerves, it is agreed that they may be defined, and I wiſh we could as well agree upon a definition. It would be an endleſſe work to reckon up, and it would no leſſe then tyre the Reader, to read all the definitions of a Sacrament, which may be found among thoſe that treat of this ſubject. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> reckons up ſix ſeverall definitions of thoſe that either really are, or at leaſt he would have to be of his party. Two of which, he ſaies, are gather'd out of <hi>Austin,</hi> the third is from <hi>Hugo, de Sancto Victore,</hi> the fourth is from the <hi>Maſter of the ſentences,</hi> the fifth is the definition of the <hi>Catechiſme of the Councell of Trent,</hi> and the laſt, he ſayes, is found with <hi>Gratian. Bellar. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis in genere Cap.</hi> 11. And <hi>Cap.</hi> 13. he names two others, one of <hi>Scotus,</hi> and the other of <hi>Occam.</hi> which he ſaies, <hi>Chemnitius</hi> blames with the other; yet <hi>Cap.</hi> 14. obſerving a great difference among us (as he ſaith) in our definitions of a Sacrament, ſaith it is an evident argument that we are departed from the truth which is one, when his own party can keep the truth, and differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with it. <hi>Whitaker</hi> confeſſeth, that <hi>Luther, Melanccton, Chemnitius, Martyr,</hi> do differently define a Sacrament, but all their definitions (he ſaith) come to one. He reſts in the definition that <hi>Calvin</hi> gives, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Inſtitut. Cap.</hi> 14. which he defends
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:168215:27"/> againſt the objections of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> who ſpends the whole ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chap. of his book againſt it. And a definition indeed ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly exact. But ſeeing the Spirit of God himſelf hath furniſhed us with a definition of a Sacrament, which either explicitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth, or virtually comprizeth all, that according to Scriptures can be required in a Sacrament, I ſuppoſe that will carry moſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and this the Apoſtle delivers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. <hi>And he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſign of Circumciſion a ſeal of the righteouſneſſe of faith.</hi> This <hi>Whitaker</hi> ſaies,<note n="a" place="margin">Haec br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>That which belongs to every ſpecies, is rightly applyed to the Genus; that which belongs to every particular, is juſtly applyed to all
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:168215:28"/> univerſally, A man, A horſe, and every other Creature of an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal life is ſenſible, moves, &amp;c. and therefore it is rightly ſaid that every animal is ſenſible and moves: ſo it is rightly ſaid that the Paſſeover, the Lords Supper, and every other Sacrament is as a ſign,</hi> (which adverſaries confeſſe) <hi>ſo a ſeal of this righteouſneſſe,</hi> and therefore that which is ſaid by the Apoſtle of this Sacrament in particular, is true of all in generall.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I ſay, the Apoſtle mentions there nothing properly to Circumciſion, as diſtinguiſhing it from other Sacraments, all that is in the definition, with equall reaſon belongs to all Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as well as to Circumciſion, and diſtinguiſhes them onely from other Ordinances; what is ſaid of <hi>Abraham</hi> in this text, might be applyed to the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> or the Jaylour, changing alone the name of Circumciſion into Baptiſme. He received the ſign of Baptiſme, a ſeal of the righteouſneſſe of the faith, that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unbaptized.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is further objected by <hi>Bellar. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, Cap</hi> 17. and after him by others, that Circumciſion is not here ſaid to be a ſeal univerſally to any faith, but only a ſeal of the individuall faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and then it can neither be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of a Sacrament in the generall, nor yet a definition of Circumciſion, the diſtinct ſpecies of it, which is cleere in that it is expreſſely ſaid, that it was a ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of the faith that he had being yet uncircumciſed, that he might be the father of all them that beleeve. But onely <hi>Abraham</hi> could be ſuch a father, and therefore <hi>Abrahams</hi> Circumciſion, not every mans is here held forth.</p>
                     <p>This I have fully anſwered, Treatiſe of the Covenant, Chap. 26. pag. 187, 188. in my aſſertion of the purity of the Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and therefore I ſhall not now ſtand to repeat.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It is objected, this will ill agree to the Circumciſion of others, that after <hi>Abraham</hi> did receive this Sacrament; It cannot be fairely ſaid, that <hi>Iſaac</hi> received the ſign of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, a ſeal of the righteouſneſſe of the faith, which he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet uncircumciſed, ſeeing he was not in the faith till after Circumciſion; and that is no definition of Circumciſion, that agrees not to all mens Circumciſion; that is no definition of the ſpecies, that agrees not to every <hi>individuum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Neither is it needfull that that additionall particle which is proper to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as a leading perſon in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:168215:28"/> to enter into it, ſhould agree to all mens Circumciſion: He was in the faith, and had it ſealed; <hi>Iſaac</hi> was confederate with him in Covenant, and was upon that account to be circumciſed, which engaged to actual faith; and upon actual believing it ſealed this righteouſneſs of faith to him: This precedency of faith is a ſeparable adjunct, and comes not into the definition. To make the definition full and clear, the whole text of the Apoſtle is to be taken into conſideration with the context, and all that in the Hiſtory, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. to which it relates, hath relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to it, all which is vertually in the words comprized; where we may obſerve,
<list>
                           <item>1. The Perſon receiving, or by right intereſſed.</item>
                           <item>2. The thing received.</item>

                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Perſon receiving, or by right intereſſed is <hi>Abraham,</hi> and giving, and receiving being relatives (as <hi>Pareus</hi> on the words obſerves) if <hi>Abraham</hi> received it, it is neceſſarily implyed, that there is ſome one that gave it; Chriſt ſayes, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Moſes</hi> gave Circumciſion to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> becauſe he delivered unto them a Law concerning it, <hi>Levit.</hi> 12.3. but God gave it in charge to <hi>Moſes,</hi> as we may ſee there, verſ. 1. as, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.9, 10. he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given it in charge to <hi>Abraham;</hi> And therefore Chriſt ſaith, that Circumciſion was of the Fathers. God is then the author, as <hi>Abraham</hi> the receiver of Circumciſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Abraham</hi> that thus received Circumciſion from the hand of God may be conſidered,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As a man, ſo he ſtood in no other relation to God, then barely as his creature, and with others in the world was without God, and not within the verge of his Covenant, and for ſeventy and five years he thus continued,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As a profeſſor of the faith, and worſhipper of the true God, renouncing the gods that he had worſhipped in <hi>Charran,</hi> and profeſſedly ſerving the Lord Jehovah onely.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As a man upright, and ſincere in the Covenant, comming up to the termes propoſed of God, and walking perfect before him. In all of theſe capacities <hi>Abraham</hi> may be conſidered, as any other of the ſons of <hi>Abraham</hi> that are ſincere and faithful. In the firſt capacity he had no right to Circumciſion; all that are in that condition, are called by the Apoſtle Circumciſion: yet
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:168215:29"/> it was not of neceſſity to his intereſt in the Covenant, or Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, the ſigne and ſeale of it, to be ſincere in Covenant; though it be neceſſary to the attainment of the grace of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and mercy ſealed in the Sacrament. As others came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Covenant, and were intitled to the initiating ſign and ſeale, ſo might <hi>Abraham,</hi> but others came in upon a bare profeſſion: as thoſe multitudes of Proſelytes that joyned themſelves to <hi>Iſrael:</hi> One of which was <hi>Doeg</hi> an <hi>Edomite,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.9. had he not been of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by profeſſion, he had not been detained in the Sanctuary before the Lord, upon any religious account, as we find he was, ver. 7. And had he been right in the Covenant, he had not had ſo many things in charge againſt him, neither had the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpoken in that language that we read of him. The Eunuch, as we have cauſe to think, had an heart right with God, but it was not ſo with <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> expreſly tells him, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.21. <hi>Abraham</hi> then is conſidered as a man profeſsedly in Covenant, when he received this ſign of Circumciſion.</p>
                     <p>The thing received is here Circumciſion, which I ſhall ſpeak to onely, as of a Sacramental kind; and not conſider it in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual nature of it, as the initiating Sacrament of the Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, held out under that external rite of cutting off the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin of the fleſh.</p>
                     <p>The uſe of it is, to be a ſign and ſeal for ſignification, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification to thoſe that received it.</p>
                     <p>The thing ſignified and ſealed is, <hi>the righteouſneſſe of faith,</hi> ſo it is alſo called, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. Elſewhere it is called <hi>the righteouſneſſe of God,</hi> Rom. 10.3. being freely given to us of God, and onely able to juſtifie us in his ſight; but chiefly, becauſe it is wrought by Chriſt, who was not meer man, nor barely a creature, but the <hi>true God,</hi> as St. <hi>John</hi> ſtiles him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.20. This righteouſneſs of God is applyed to us, and made ours by faith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. and therefore as it is called, the <hi>righteouſneſſe of God,</hi> ſo alſo here and elſewhere, the <hi>righteouſneſſe of faith.</hi> This text being thus cleared, a full and compleat definition of a Sacrament may be found.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The definition of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>I know there is ſomewhat put into the definition of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:168215:29"/> by ſome that treat of this ſubject, which is not here in words expreſt, and therefore upon that account, this definition may be challenged as defective; as 1.

But whether this be eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial in a Sacrament or otherwiſe, (as afterwards is to be enquired into,) it is ſufficiently implyed.

The Sacraments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain as well a profeſſion of our duty towards God, as Gods ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and ſeal to man, of which here is nothing ſaid.

                        <p>I ſhall here purpoſely wave ſeveral Schoole-niceties, as in what predicament a Sacrament is to be placed: Taking it in the whole nature of it (as conſiſting of a twofold matter, the one outward and earthly, which is the viſible ſigne; the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and heavenly, which is the thing ſignified: and of a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold forme; one outward, which is the due participation of it, according to the way preſcribed of God; the other inward, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the analogy between the ſigne, and the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied) it muſt needs be an <hi>Ens aggregatum,</hi> and ſo not capable of any place in that ſeries of being: And ſigne, and ſeale, being clearly relatives; I ſhall leave the Reader to informe himſelf from learned <hi>Keckerman,</hi> in the third Book and eighth Chapter of his <hi>Syſteme of Philoſophy:</hi> what is the <hi>Relatum,</hi> the <hi>Correla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> the relation it ſelf, the foundation, and the <hi>terminus</hi> in this Sacramental conſideration; and ſhall go on to lay open the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of this definition. The whole of it being comprized in this text of the Apoſtle, every part affords ſome doctrinal Obſervation. In the firſt place I ſhall obſerve that,</p>
                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:168215:30"/>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sacraments are ſignes,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The truth of this obſervation is ſo clear of it ſelf, that it needs no proof; Taking the word Sacrament in the largeſt ſenſe that we can ſpeak of it (in which it falls ſhort of theſe Goſpel-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances known by that name) it is yet <hi>Sacrae rei Signum, the ſign of an holy thing:</hi> And might be made good by a particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, not only in thoſe that we receive as Sacraments, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extraordinary as the Cloud, the Red-Sea, Manna, and the Rock, which the Apoſtle parallells with Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1, 2. But alſo in the ordinary ſtated Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by a ſtanding law to be obſerved. In Circumciſion there was a foreskin to be cut off, in the Paſſeover a Lambe to be eaten: In Baptiſme there is water to be applyed, and in the Lords Supper bread and wine to be taken, eaten, and drunk; God condeſcending in mercy to our weakneſs, by earthly things to informe our judgments, and ſtrengthen our faith in that which is heavenly. Though Papiſts are much put to it, to find an outward ſign in ſome of their Sacraments, (as indeed in ſome of them there is none at all) yet they yeeld to this truth; that Sacraments have their ſigns, knowing that to be a true, though not a full definition, tnat a Sacrament is an outward viſibie ſign of an inward ſpiritual grace. That we may come to a right underſtanding of Sacramental ſigns, we muſt</p>
                        <p>Firſt, know what a ſign in general is.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the ſeveral ſorts and kinds of ſigns, ſo farre at leaſt as will conduce to a right underſtanding of the point in hand; and Laſtly enquire what Sacramental ſigns are, and their proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>

                           <note place="margin">What is meant by a ſign.</note>A ſign <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath long ſince defined to be, <hi>that which ſhewes it ſelf to the ſenſes, and ſomewhat more beſides it ſelf to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding;</hi> and in other words,<note n="a" place="margin">Signum eſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res praeter ſpeciem quam ingerit ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus aliud ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid ex ſefaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens in cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem venire.</note> 
                           <hi>A ſign is a thing which brings to mens thoughts another thing, beſides that which it offers to the ſenſes.</hi> As the Rain-bowe offers it ſelf to the eyes (we ſee the ſhape of it, and the colours in it) and brings the promiſe of God into our minds, that the Floud ſhall no more return to deſtroy the earth. It were an endleſs labour to undertake to lay down the ſeveral kinds of ſignes, with all their ſub-diviſions: I never ſaw ſuch a Scheme of them, but I have thought many more might
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:168215:30"/> be added to them;<note place="margin">Neque enim hujus generis quiſquam enmeravit omnia, naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuntur enim nova pro homi num arbitrio. <hi>Pulling. Deca.</hi> 5. <hi>Ser.</hi> 6. <hi>A diſtribution of ſigns. Natural ſigns.</hi>
                           </note> yet thoſe at leaſt that are notable may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to certayn heads. Some are naturall, ſome are prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and ſome are ſigns by inſtitution. Natural ſigns are thoſe that of themſelves, and of their own nature are apt to ſignifie ſomewhat beyond themſelves; As ſmoke ſignifies fire, a Rain-bowe ſhowres, paleneſe ſickneſs, Teares trouble, and grief of mind; of theſe Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.2, 3. <hi>When it is even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ye ſay, It will be fair weather, for the skie is red; and in the morning, It will be foul weather to day, for the skie is red and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</hi> Now theſe ſignes are ſometimes (as ſignes ſo alſo) cauſes of the thing ſignified; As the Sun beames in the dawning are a ſign, and alſo a cauſe of the day approaching. The interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Moon between us and the Sun, and of the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Sun and Moon (foreſeen in their motions) are ſigns, and cauſes of Eclipſes. Sometimes they are effects of the thing that they ſignifie; As ſmoke is the effect of fire, and paleneſs of diſeaſes. Some are barely ſigns, and neither cauſes nor effects; as the colour of the skie is no cauſe of rain, but barely an indication that there are thoſe watry vapours in the air that will diſſolve themſelves on the earth: They may be effects of that which is the, cauſe of the thing ſignified, but not the effects of that which is a ſign. The Rain-bowe is an effect of that which is a cauſe of rain;<note place="margin">Rules for the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſigns. Remote cauſes are not ſigns.</note> Here we might lay down ſome rules or obſervations.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, Remote cauſes (which have their effects at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſo that many things may interpoſe themſelves as remoraes, cannot be looked upon by any as ſigns. When that book of common-prayer was impoſed by authority upon <hi>Scotland,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on counſel then over-much heeded; it might have been eaſily concluded upon, as a ſign of troubles and diſſenſions in preſent there; But no rational man could then have made it a prognoſtick of all thoſe tragical ſtirs, which in three Nations have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready happened, and we yet know not upon the flame kindled what may follow: The ſpark then kindled, might in probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have been quenched. The Stars ſay our Stargazers, have their influence upon mens bodies, and by conſequence indirectly upon the operations of their ſoules. Hereupon by the poſture of the Stars at mens birth, they will conclude the trade of life in which men ſhall be employed, the Arts that they ſhall profeſs, the fortunes (as the world calls them) to which they ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:168215:31"/> and the very laſt period of their dayes. But here ſo many things may interpoſe, that the childs Genius ſuppoſedly thus diſpoſed, cannot ſway all theſe things, Parents, friends, wayes of Education, thouſands of obſtacles, and diverſifications ſo intervene, that no judgement can be given. If more were granted then ever will be proved of the heavens influence on mens minds and bodies to incline, or diſpoſe them; yet that of the Wiſe man would utterly ſpoyle all Predictions, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.11. <hi>The race is not to the ſwift, nor the battel to the ſtrong, neither yet bread to the wiſe, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Seeondly, Partial cauſes in nature cannot be looked upon as ſigns,<note place="margin">Patrial cauſes are no ſigns</note> but all muſt concurre that have any influence. This (if I do not miſ-remember) good Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> doth ſet down in a ſimilitude to this purpoſe. The heat of an Hen ſitting upon Eggs is the cauſe of a brood of young ones; but ſuppoſe an Hen ſhould ſit on Eggs of divers kinds, ſome of a Dove, ſome of a Partridge, ſome of a Pheſant, ſome of a Hawk, ſome of a Kite; who could now from the heat of the Hen, give his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what kind, the birds ſhould be, that this heat would hatch? would they not be different in kind according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of ſubjects that this heat works upon? If we ſee flint be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, this is no ſign of fire to be kindled, unleſs we ſee ſteele with it; nor yet flint and ſteele without tinder; nor yet flint, ſteele and tinder, without a hand employed to ſtrike fire: all put together make up a ſign, and not otherwiſe. To apply this to our purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, Let it be granted, that the heavens have their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on mens bodies on earth, no otherwiſe then the heat of the Hen hath for procreation of ſuch a kind, or the flint to the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of fire, yet the heavens have their influence upon divers, and diverſified objects: not diverſified by their influence only, but done to their hands, we derive our being from Parents, not onely in our eſſentials, and integrals, but in a great meaſure in our temperature of body and mind. Who ſees not vertues and defects of body and mind to be hereditary, and that from either ſex, Children do <hi>patrizare,</hi> follow their Parents inclination without any imitation? now the heavens were not in the ſame poſture, <hi>Mars, Jupiter, &amp;c.</hi> were not in the ſame aſcendent, in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:168215:31"/> their birth as in ours. A begger is delivered under the ſame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the heavens with a Noble-woman, ſhall the children of both be of the ſame trade and way?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, If the Stars and their influences were univerſal cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of what is done in, and ſhall befall our perſons, yet theſe men profeſs acquaintance onely with ſome few, and thoſe almoſt onely the Planets; The Stars of an unfixt motion. Thoſe innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Stars, which we call fixt, and have been ſaid to be in the eighth (which we call the ſtarry) ſphere, are not obſerved nor known in their various poſtures, what ſome may incline to, others will thwart and deſtroy.</p>

If the heavens are alike cauſes of mans vicious wayes, &amp; of the ruine and bane of Nations, endeavours for prevention will be equally vain; whether it be by prayer, or repentance. He that cannot make the Sun to ſtand ſtill, or to return back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by prayer, let him not think to ſtand in the gap for a land, or turn away Gods fiery indignation, ſeeing the courſe of nature appointed of God, brings it about above reſiſtance. I have heard of ſome <hi>Rabbins</hi> that pray every night that the Sun may riſe again, and the earth enjoy a new morning, as though it were no otherwiſe in nature by the God of nature ordered, and ſetled, but it lay in them to hinder it; but Chriſtians have learned better, then to think by their prayers to impoſe a new courſe on the way of nature. And knowing that prayer and repentance are wayes appointed of God, and by experience ſuccesfull for reverſal of judgements, and prevention of Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſolations, they know that Stars in a way of nature cannot effect it, nor yet the ſons or diſciples of nature foreſee or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell it.</p>

A Souldiers Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, or the word that is given on his guard, or in fight is ſuch a ſign. 2. There are ſignes by inſtitution from God, ſuch was the rainebowe; It may be a naturall ſign of ſhowers; but it is by inſtitution, that it ſignifies, that there ſhall not be any more a flood to deſtroy the earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.11. Theſe inſtituted ſignes, whether of God, or man, admit of other diſtinctions, which will be touched upon in the next place, in opening the nature, and ſhewing the properties of Sacramentall ſignes. There are ſignes of a fourth ſort which might have been ſpoken to, namely thoſe that are Diabolicall or ſuperſtitious; But I ſhall not trouble my ſelf or the Reader with them.</p>

The foreskin in Circumciſion, the lamb in the Paſſeover, water in Baptiſme, bread and wine in the Lords Supper, with all the actions of each of theſe are viſible; And thus a Sacrament by the Ancients hath ſtill been defined, An outward and viſible ſign of an inward and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall grace, which hath never been excepted againſt as unſound; but only as inſufficient.

And therefore ſounds or words, are no Sacramental ſignes, which being no object of ſight, nor of any other ſenſe, but of that of hearing, they are not in any ſuch capacity.

There are ſome ſigns have their ſignification wholly from their inſtitution, and of themſelves carry no propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:168215:34"/> There are a third ſort of ſignes of a middle nature, that have their reſemblance of the thing ſignified, but in that indeterminate confuſed manner, that they may rather be ſaid to be fit to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that whereof they are ſignes, then that of themſelves without further declaration added they do ſignifie.

In Baptiſme there is not onely water, but the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the perſon to the water in dipping, or the water to the perſon by infuſion, or ſprinkling. The word in Scripture uſe comprizes any waſhing; and therefore in Baptiſme it is of it ſelf indifferent. In the Lords Supper there is not onely bread and wine, but the bread is broke, the bread and cup delivered, receiving, eating, and drinking. Some indeed queſtion, whether the breaking of the bread be any Sacramental rite; or at all of the integrality of the Sacrament? but all confeſſe that in caſe it be within an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, it is then neceſſary.

The Senatour was diſtinguiſhed from the Knight by his Purple, and the Knight from one of the Commonalty by his ring; as with us a Knight of the Garter is diſtinguiſhed by his blue Ribband, and a Knight of the Bath by the red; yet they cannot be denyed, but that they have this diſtinguiſhing uſe. By theſe Sacramental ſignes the people of God are known from others, which is herein plain, in that they are ſignes of the Covenant, and by an uſual metonomy called by the name of the Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.20. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.8. And therefore diſtinguiſhed thoſe that received them from all that are out of Covenant. So Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion diſtinguiſhed a <hi>Jew</hi> from all others. A man in uncircumciſion was an heathen. Circumciſion in the fleſh did denominate a <hi>Jew</hi> outwardly, as Circumciſion of the heart (which is that to which Circumciſion in the letter did engage) did denominate a man a <hi>Jew</hi> inwardly. That which Circumciſion was in this reſpect, Baptiſme is: As ſoon as any joyned himſelf to <hi>Abrahams</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and afterwards to the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> in Covenant, he was to be circumciſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.13. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48. None were to be as one born in the land, but a circumciſed man. As ſoon as any joyned himſelf to the body and ſociety of Chriſtians, he was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, ſo was Chriſts Commiſſion, <hi>Diſciple all Nations, baptizing them.</hi> No ſooner was <hi>Paul,</hi> the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> the <hi>Jaylour,</hi> Lydia, yea, <hi>Simon Magus</hi> made diſciples, but they were forthwith baptized, The Paſſeover as well as Circumciſion, the Lords Supper, as well as Baptiſme are diſtinguiſhing ſignes. But theſe find men before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand diſtinguiſhed. The preceding Sacraments whereby men are initiated and firſt enrolled, are more properly diſtinguiſhing.</p>

                           </note> this may ſeem contradictory to the former, which makes them diſtinguiſhing, and differencing. To unite and difference are evidently contrary, but theſe well enough agree, the contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being not <hi>ad idem.</hi> They are not the ſame that they unite and difference; They diſtinguiſh men in Covenant from ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and they unite men in Covenant as one among themſelves. A Souldiers Colours difference him from all other companies, and unite him to thoſe of that body into which he is received. As Philoſophers ſay of heat, that it doth <hi>congregare homogenea,</hi>
                           <pb n="48" facs="tcp:168215:35"/> and <hi>diſſipare heterogenea,</hi> gather together thoſe things that are of a like, and ſeparate thoſe that are of a different quality; ſo it is with Sacraments. This the Apoſtle takes for granted, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. His buſineſs there is to take Chriſtians off from joyning with heathens in their Idol-ſacrifices, becauſe ſuch joyning makes them one body with thoſe Idolaters. Which is clear in the 19, 20, 21. v. <hi>What ſay I then? that the Idol is any thing? or that which is offered in ſacrifice to Idols is any thing? but I ſay, that the things which the Gentiles ſacrifice, they ſacrifice to Devlls, and not to God; and I would not that ye ſhould have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with Devils; ye cannot drink of the Cup of the Lord, and of the Cup of Devils; ye cannot he partakers of the Lords Table, and of the table of Devils.</hi> And this he had alſo argued againſt, Chap. 8. Verſ. 10. And he proves that this makes them one Idolatrous body with Gentiles, in their ſacrifices to Devls, by way of an analogy with Chriſtian and Jewiſh worſhip. Becauſe joyning in the Lords Supper to partake of one bread, makes men one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Chriſtian, and partaking with Jewes after the fleſh, eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their ſacrifices, made partakers of the Altar of the Jewes and one body Jewiſh, verſ. 17, 18. therefore joyning with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens in their worſhip makes one body heatheniſh. A text which ſome weakly enough have brought againſt mixt commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, to prove, that none muſt joyn with a bad man in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Sacrament, when it onely ſerves to prove that Chriſtians may not joyn with Idolaters in the Devils Sacraments. They difference us from all thoſe that want, and joyne us unto all thoſe that enjoy theſe badges of a Chriſtian profeſſion.</p>

Upon account of this oneneſs between the ſign and the thing ſignified, ſometimes the ſign is ſaid to be the thing ſignified, as that Bread is the body of Chriſt, and the Cup the blood of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.26, 27, So that that of <hi>Auſtin</hi> is famous, <hi>that Chriſt ſaid, This is my body, when he gave the ſign of his body.</hi> Circumciſion is called the Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.9, 10, 11. <hi>Ast.</hi> 7.8.

In all of theſe places, the ſigne hath the name of the thing ſignified; by reaſon of Analogy and repreſentation, and all by inſtitution: ſometimes on the other hand, the thing ſignified is called by the name of, and is ſaid to be the ſign, as, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7.

Of all Scripture-Sacraments, and all thoſe additional forged Sacraments of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> one onely is by them thus honoured. The Paſchal Lambe was not turned into the body of Chriſt, nor is water turned into the blood of Chriſt in Baptiſme; Nor do any other of their ſuppoſed ſignes loſe their nature, onely in the Lords Supper bread is not bread, (though it be ſtill called bread) but fleſh; wine is not wine, (though called the fruit of the vine) but blood; we ſee bread, we taſte bread, we handle bread; and yet we muſt not give credit either to our eyes, ears, taſte, or touch, but we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it is no bread. It hath the natural properties of bread and wine; it gives natural nouriſhment as bread and wine; the bread, if eaten in exceſſe, and the wine drunken will cauſe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, and intoxicate as bread and wine. As the natural force, ſo the natural defects of bread and wine, ſtill remain after conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The bread breeds wormes, and the wine turnes to vineger; yet we muſt believe. that God by miracle hath taken away bread and wine, given blood and fleſh, turned bread into fleſh, wine into blood, and yet ſtill by miracles keeps up the natural ſhape, properties and defects of theſe outward Elements. When God in Scripture wrought miracles, the miracles were ſeen and known. There have been tranſubſtantiations, but thoſe were never hidden; <hi>Moſes</hi> his rod was turned into a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and it was ſeen to be a Serpent; ſo that <hi>Moſes</hi> on ſight fled from it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.3. It was turned again into a rod, and known to be a rod, verſ. 4. Chriſt turnes water into wine. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.9. that was not judged to be ſtill water, or called by that name, but by the taſte known to be of the moſt precious wine, verſ. 10. But our ſenſes having thus deceived us, and made us believe that there is ſtill bread and wine, when by miracle bread and wine is gone, where ſhall we find any Word to ground our faith to believe this deluſion? The words of the inſtitution or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing muſt carry it.</p>

                           <hi>This is my body, this Cup is my blood in the New Teſtament:</hi> But ſuch an interpretation, 1. Deſtroyes the outward ſign, and makes it no Sacrament. 2. Makes the ſpeech wholly not Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental. No Sacramental ſpeech can be proper, and we have
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:168215:37"/> enough from out adverſaries to excuſe our faith from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of any ſuch a change. If we look no further then three teſtimonies quoted by learned Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> from three Romiſh Cardinals in his diſcourſe of tranſubſtantiation, Pag. 2. 3. Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine (ſaith he) granteth that theſe words, This is my body, may imply either ſuch a real change of the bread as the Catholiques hold, or ſuch a figurative change as the Calviniſts hold; but will not bear that ſenſe that the Lutherans give it. And Cardinal Cajetan acknowledgeth, and freely confeſſeth, that there appeareth not any thing out of the Goſpel that may enforce us to underſtand thoſe words. This is my body properly. And he addeth, that nothing in the text hindreth, but that thoſe words may as well be taken in a metaphorical ſenſe, as thoſe words of the Apoſtle, the Rock was Chriſt; and that the words of either propoſition may well be true, though the thing there ſpoken be not underſtood in a proper ſenſe, but in a metaphorical ſenſe onely.</hi> And he further <hi rend="sup">q</hi> ſaith, <hi>he finds alleadged out of Biſhop Fiſher (whom Bellar. lib. de Scriptor.</hi> Eccleſiaſt.

Therefore Chriſt having uttered a parable to the multitude, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.11. and <hi>Peter</hi> requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Declare unto us this parable,</hi> ver. 15. ſaith, <hi>Are ye alſo yet without underſtanding?</hi> Parables explained are the plaineſt way of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,

Now what words are to the eares in ſimilitudes and compariſons, that Sacramentall ſignes are to the eyes; by both the underſtanding is holpen, the memory refreſht, and as may (God willing) be unfolded, faith ſtrengthened. The cleanſing from ſin, we find in Scripture held forth under the metaphor of pouring out water, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25. <hi>Then will I ſprinkle clean water upon you, and ye ſhall be clean from all your filthineſſe, and from all your Idols will I cleanſe you.</hi> To which the Apoſtle alludes, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.26. where he ſaith, <hi>Chriſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Church, and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it by the waſhing of water, by the word.</hi> Which was typified alſo in thoſe divers waſhings mentioned by the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. which the blood of Chriſt doth really work, <hi>Purging our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences from dead works, to ſerve the living God, cleanſing us from all ſin,</hi> 1 John 1.7. and therefore it is called the <hi>ſprinkling of the blood of Jeſus,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.2.

Signes among men muſt have their ſignifications known as well as founds in muſical, and military inſtruments; otherwiſe as none could know in the one what is piped, or harped, nor upon ſound could prepare themſelves to battell, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.7, 8. ſo in the other, none can know what is ſhadowed out or reſembled.

                           <p>Fourthly, It is not eſſential to a Sacrament,<note place="margin">A preciſe forme of wo ds not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall in a Sacrament.</note> that a preciſe forme of words be obſerved in the adminiſtration of it, ſo that the being of a Sacrament is loſt if a word be changed; But it is ſufficient, that the ſumme and ſubſtance of the inſtitution be held out, and repeated; and the ſigns accordingly in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration applyed to the end for which, they are ordained, to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate and ſeal the thing ſignified to thoſe that partake of it, (though a licentious freedom of variation of the words is to be avoyded, ſo the ſenſe and meaning of the inſtitution may be, if not loſt, yet at leaſt obſcured) there being no ſecret force in the ſyllables themſelves, uttered with all the conſecrating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention that the Prieſt can imagine, to create a new Sacrament.</p>

And thoſe mentioned, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.5. were baptized in the Name of the Lord Jeſus. And <hi>Bonaventure</hi> (as he is quoted by <hi>Whita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>) ſayes that <hi>the Apoſtles baptized in the name of Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>Scotus</hi> (as the ſame Author affirms) ſayes, that <hi>if any ſhould baptize in that manner, he durſt not ſay it were no Baptiſme,</hi> and this with good reaſon; ſeeing Baptiſme in the Name of Chriſt, virtually comprizes the whole Trinity, Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, His work being to reconcile man unto God, eſſentially, and not perſonally conſidered. 2. Either the very ſyllables themſelves, in which the inſtitution is ſet down, is the forme, and contains the eſſence of Baptiſme, or elſe the ſenſe and meaning: But it is not the very words and ſyllables themſelves. This is clear in reaſon, and confeſt by the adverſary. Firſt, it is clear in reaſon, then the ſame words and ſyllables muſt be uſed in which they were pronounced, when they were firſt inſtituted; That was the <hi>Syriack</hi> Tongue, (as is believed) being the language in <hi>Judea</hi> at that time, or at leaſt the <hi>Greek,</hi> in which Tongue the words of the inſtitution were committed to writing. But the forme of the Sacraments is never tyed to thoſe Tongues, to nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them. Papiſts officiate in Latine, Orthodox Churches in their own language, in which the ſame thing in other ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles is held forth. This is confeſt by the adverſary. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> approves (as we have heard) the ratification of that Baptiſme, where ſcarce ever a word was aright uttered, and that upon this account, that it might be eaſily underſtood what he would have ſaid, as well by the act of baptizing as by the word, <hi>In nomine,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:168215:41"/> In the name,</hi> for that was aright pronounced. It is not then the words, but that which ought to be intended in the words that holds forth the inſtitution, which may be further from the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite</hi> cleared, in that he confeſſes, Scripture to be too ſhort, to hold out the forme of Baptiſme-inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which<note n="l" place="margin">Nos reſpondemus, illud (hoc facite) referre ad totam actionem Chriſti, ita ut comprehendat etiam verba, Id quod (ut omittam nunc alia argumenta) diſcimus ex traditione, &amp; uſu Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cae Eccleſiae quae traditio ſi non reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatur in dubium revocabitur etiàm for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma baptiſmi, nam unde, quaeſo, colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitur, dum aqua aſpergitur, dicenda eſſe illa verba: Baptizo te in nomine Patris &amp; filii &amp; Spiritus ſancti?

This <hi>Chamier</hi> worthily rejects, as a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny put upon proteſtant Writers: No proteſtant Writer ever did affirm it: <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would fain faſten it upon <hi>Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> but confeſſes that <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeaks doubtfully in it; And ſometimes ſeemes to ſpeak of a Sermon, as diſtinct from the Sacrament. They that hold this opinion, muſt not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it to be the greateſt of prophanations to adminiſter the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments when no Sermon is preached; But whenſoever they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter any Sacrament, their Sermon muſt ever be of that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; for to make a Sermon eſſential to Sacraments, which treats nothing about Sacraments, is to make the body of a bird eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to a beaſt. That which we ſay, is, that every word in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of Sacraments is for inſtruction of communicants, and without ſuch inſtruction, they can make no actuall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of them to any ſpiritual benefit, either of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ſanctification; which yet is not of abſolute neceſſity to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:168215:42"/> be preſt, as oft as ever the Sacrament is taken; And words about the Sacrament teaching, and conſecrating are not (as they make them) of an oppoſite kind. All words tending to conſecration as <hi>[I baptize thee in the Name of the Father, &amp;c. This is my body, This Cup, &amp;c.]</hi> are words as well to inſtruct, as to conſecrate; are <hi>Concionatoria</hi> as well, as <hi>Conſecratoria:</hi> ſo that all words of conſecration are words for inſtruction (though all for inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are not for conſecration) as might many wayes be eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. 1. They are ſignificant words, to be uttered by the voyce of a publick teacher. 2. They are Scripture words, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is there writen, is for our learning, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. why is it wrote if not for reading? Why do we read if not for learning? 3. The Apoſtles to whom Chriſt gave charge concerning the Sacrament, were to underſtand themſelves what they did, and to inſtruct thoſe to whom they did commend it likewiſe. But they had no other way to know the Sacraments, either of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, or the Lords Supper, but from the words of inſtitution, which they call by the name of conſecration. 4. The Apoſtle going about to reforme the abuſes about the Lords Supper, and to teach the <hi>Corinthians</hi> a right way of celebration, repeates the whole inſtitution, and layes down exactly that which they ſay is of the eſſence of conſecration, and that to inſtruct, &amp; not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate. The words of conſecration are his words of inſtruction. 5.

                        <p>This is clear of it ſelf, and hath ſcarce any adverſary. Look through all Sacraments, whether ordinary, or extraordinary, whether taken in the largeſt ſignification for holy ſignes, or in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, as here defined; we ſhall ſtill find that they were by Divine appointment; The <hi>Cloud,</hi> the <hi>Paſſage through the Red-Sea,</hi> Exod. 13. <hi>Manna,</hi> Exod. 16.

The people of the Jewes certainly had another opinion of his Baptiſme, as appears by their reaſoning, when Chriſt demanded, <hi>The Baptiſme of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? and they reaſoned with themſelves, ſaying, If we ſhall ſay from heaven, he will ſay unto us, Why did ye not then beleeve him? But if we ſhall ſay of men, we fear the people; for all hold John as a Prophet,</hi> Matth. 21.25.26. When the opinion among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:168215:43"/> was ſo generall, that the Chief Prieſts and Elders were afraid to oppoſe it, had it been an errour doubtleſſe Chriſt would not in that way have nouriſhed them in it; And to ſay with <hi>Bellarmine</hi> that<note place="margin">Deus ſolum in genere inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit, &amp; inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one, illa man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davit ut bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaret: ſed ritum in particulari quo baptizan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum eſſet, ipſe Johannes inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit, non a Deo prae ſcriptum accepit.</note> 
                           <hi>God did command him to baptize, but the particular rite was left unto John himſelf,</hi> is nothing. When Chriſt demanded of the Baptiſme of John, whether it were from heaven, or of men? the Prieſts and Elders to whom he ſpake, underſtood the whole work, and to conceit that the work was commanded, and the way of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concealed, is an ungrounded fancy. All that are confeſt to be Sacraments, are (we ſee) yeelded to be of Divine inſtitution, which is further plain in reaſon.</p>
                        <p>Firſt Sacraments are parts of worſhip, a piece of the homage that is due from man to God; And it is God, and not man that is to preſcribe in his own worſhip; here God hath declared himſelf to be jealous, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.5. that not any thing of the invention of man come within that worſhip that is Divine. And if <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> fell for adulterating the worſhip of God, bringing in ſtrange fire, when fire from heaven was provided to their hands; How ſhall they ſtand that coin a worſhip it ſelf, as do our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, or put a new ſtamp upon it, when it is ſet up of God, which is their way likewiſe? Marriage which is an Ordinance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Church, they make a Sacrament in the Church; Of duties they make ordination, and repentance Sacraments; and in caſe Phariſees made the Commandements of God void by their tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when they impoſed a neceſſity of waſhing of hands before meat, when yet they did not raiſe it to the honour of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; How much more had <hi>John</hi> offended, if out of his own fancy he had ſet up ſuch an Ordinance as Baptiſme? <hi>David</hi> hath been charged that he appointed ſingers, and other officers in the houſe of God, without any command or direction from heaven; but the contrary to this appeares, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.25. where in the life of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>He ſet the Levites in the houſe of the Lord, with Cymbals, with Pſalteries, and with harpes, according to the commandement of David, and of Gad the Kings Seer, and Nathan the Prophet; for ſo was the Commandement of the Lord by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, Sacraments are notes of diſtinction between the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God and others that beare not that relation to him, as we have heard Circumciſion and uncircumciſion divided the world. The Circumciſed were a people of God, when all others were
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:168215:44"/> children of a ſtrange god, ſo we may ſay of all Sacraments; And as men of place alone have power to give liveries to their own ſervants, to diſtinguiſh them from thoſe that have their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on others, ſo God hath alone power to give differencing Cognizances to his ſervants likewiſe.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, God onely can give ſtrength and efficacy to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments; what that is reſts to be enquired, and is not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted; but whatſoever it is, that it is wholly of God was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doubted; and he onely that can give efficacy to them, is to ordaine them. This is <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> his reaſon in the place mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, Sacraments are teaching ſignes, viſible words, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by man is inſtructed in Divine myſteries; but God alone is the author of the Word; <hi>It is given by inſpiration of God,</hi> 1 Timothy 3.15. God alone therefore is the author of Sacraments.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, Sacraments are ſeales put to promiſe, annext for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of Covenants, as ſhall be further ſhewen. But he onely that makes the promiſe and appoints the Covenant, can give the ſeal. The Schoolman then (quoted by <hi>Bullinger, de Sacr. Decad.</hi> 5. <hi>Ser.</hi> 6.) hath well minded the Church, that ſhe is no Lady over the Sacraments, but barely a ſervant, and can no more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a Sacrament, then abrogate a Divine Commandement. And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> puts this for the firſt reaſon, that Miniſters are Stewards of the Myſteries of God; therefore they are not to inſtitute them, but being inſtituted of God, are onely to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter them.</p>
                        <p>This holds true not onely of Sacraments in their eſſence, that none may adde any to the number of thoſe that God hath inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted; But of all that is of the integrality of Sacraments likewiſe there is not the leaſt Sacramental rite, that is to be of humane, but all of Divine inſtitution. There is the ſame reaſon of the whole, and of every part. He that may not appoint a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may appoint no piece of a Sacrament. A worſhip made up of Divine and humane Commandements, ſtands in the Church like <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> image, the <hi>head of Gold,</hi> but the <hi>feet of earth.</hi> The Poets device of a mans neck joyned to a horſes head is not ſo great a ſoloeciſme. <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> ſaw that this might be objected againſt much in the Sacraments in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore when he had put the queſtion, Whether Sacraments have their inſtitution from God? in the firſt place objecteth,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:168215:44"/>
                           <note n="c" place="margin">Ea quae ſunt divinitus inſtituta, t a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duntur nobis in ſacra Scriptura, ſed quaedam aguntur in Sacramentis, de quibus nulla fit mentio in ſacra Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura, puta de Chriſmate, quo homines confirmantur, &amp; oleo quo Sacerdotes inunguntur, &amp; de multis aliis tam ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis quam factis quibus utimur in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentis.

If we look at the terrene part of theſe inſtitutions, our thoughts may then fall flat, and their eſteem very low; many a creature of God will ſtand in competition with them: Themſelves being of earth muſt needs fix our thoughts to earth, and ſo there will be no more then bare formality in the work, perhaps a confuſed conceit of ſome holy thing which is little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, begetting a ſuperſtitious blind devotion: But when we conſider from whoſe hand they are, and the end for which they ſerve, as ſeales appointed of God, to ratifie to our ſouls his gift of Chriſt, pardon of ſin by him, and conſequently glory with him; theſe deſpiſed Ordinances will be in more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. We look upon Parchment, Inke, Wax, in the ſhops where they are put to ſale, as common Commodities: thouſand of ſhops have more high-prized wares; How low do men look on them comparative to thoſe things of which the Exchange glories: But he that hath one skin of this Parchment, made up into a pattent, or deed with the Broad-ſeal to it; confirming a grant of ſome large revenue, eyes it in another manner, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes it above thouſands of all that we have ſpoken of, as not with him to be named that day. We may look upon water as an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as mean as it is common, as low in our eſteem, as it is in price; and upon bread and wine as ſomewhat more noble: But a ſlender pittance of either, is with us of ſlender value. But when they ſerve for a ſeal of all that the Goſpel tenders, and are made up into a ſeal of the Goſpel grant, it ſhould be, and to a ſpiritual eye is, of more high, and honourable regard. If this were duly conſidered, Sacraments would be had in more honour with us.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The contempt, or neglect of Baptiſmo cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured.</note>Firſt, The Sacrament of Baptiſme, that door of entrance into the Church of Chriſt, our matriculation into the ſociety of Saints; when other Ordinances are over in the Congregation,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:168215:45"/> and that entered upon, we ſee the way of a great party imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to poſt out: The Apoſtles thought it too low a buſineſs for the Lord Chriſt to have to deal with infants that had not legs to carry them, but muſt be brought in the armes of others; and therefore rebuked thoſe that brought them. Theſe think it below them, to waite upon a buſineſs where ſuch onely are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned: Infant Ordinances are below their attendance. Theſe are of two ſorts. 1. Thoſe who out of judgement leave, and are ſo principled, that they think they muſt leave, and declare their diſſent from that practice. 2. Thoſe that out of neglect leave: They judge that infants of right ought to be baptized: It is the Miniſters duty to do it, and Parents and near friends and neighbours are to ſee it done, but it might be done in a corner, with more or fewer, it doth not matter: when they are gone, it will be baptized, and what is it to them to waite on the Baptiſme of it? The firſt of theſe that in departing, act out of principles that they have laid, (and therefore in caſe they were better principled, there is hope that they might act better) are of two ſorts. 1. Thoſe that proteſt againſt all title of infants to this Ordinance; and therefore upon that account refuſe to honour it with their preſence: And their very departure from it ſpeakes this language, <hi>Here is one that is to be dedicated to God in an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance that is of God,</hi> (For I ſpeak not of thoſe that go above water-Baptiſme, they hardly come into us, and therefore do not on this account leave) <hi>but one that God will not own, being within no Covenant of his, and therefore no member of that ſociety that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to him, to whom we ſay,</hi> in caſe God will not, who then muſt receive him: If he be no member of this ſociety, nor in capacity of it, then he is alſo in an uncapacity to be ſaved? <hi>Act.</hi> 2.47. But they will not ſo determine, they ſay; but leave him to his own Maſter; But denying him a Covenant intereſt, and all title to Church-fellowſhip, they deny that Chriſt is his Maſter, (though that expreſly affirme it, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.42. yet they peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily deny it) and ſo thruſt him from all intereſt in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. Papiſts were the firſt in this cruel infant-damning principle, That they are out of Covenant with God; Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts taking it from them, fight for it with their weapons. May we not think that Papiſts laugh in their ſleeves, to ſee theſe men of new light, diſpute for them, reforme for them, ſeparate with them? And do they not very well know, that if by theſe mens
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:168215:46"/> help, they can bring into the Proteſtant Church their premiſes, we ſhall never be able to avoid their concluſions. Others are not ſo rigid againſt all infants, but appear more tender to ſome; Infants of believers they judge to have their intereſt; when pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents make good their part in the Covenant, and are ſteady in it, then they judge the children to be in Covenant; and this their charity (as well as it can) muſt determine. Theſe might do well, 1. To examine thoſe texts that themſelves produce for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of ſuch infants, of whoſe Parents their charity thus hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully determines, and ſee whether thoſe texts will not carry it for all the infants of profeſſing Parents. I am ſure I know none but carry it as clear for all, as they do for any. 2. Let them conſider, whether children of God are not to be baptized? Theſe infants of whoſe Parents they have ſaddeſt thoughts, are children of God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.21. Whether ſervants of God ought not to be baptized? Theſe children of ſuch Parents are ſervants of God. <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.42. Whether Saints are not to be baptized? Such children are Saints, where one Parent is removed from an infidel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14.</p>
                        <p>But the greateſt part leave us not out of error, but neglect; not as being miſled in judgement, but prophane: Let theſe ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly take to heart theſe Queries. 1. Why did you joyn in any Ordinance in publick, as that of praying, hearing, ſinging? was it not upon that account, as of God, by his appointment? Why then are thoſe attended, and this (which you allow alſo to be of God) neglected? 2. Is this the cloſing duty, doth not a bleſſing follow upon this Ordinance? quitting this you quit both; you will joyn with others in the duty: but you will give them leave to be alone in receiving a bleſſing upon it. 3. Is not he, ſhe, or they, that now are to be received a fellow-member, or members? muſt not thou, and they, make up one body? are not they a part of Chriſt myſtical, as thou? It is but a little ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that thou giveſt them, when thou haſt not patience to abide a few minutes, to be a witneſs of their happy initiation. 4. Doth not their caſe, upon this account call for thy prayers? the Churches prayers.? It would ſcarce pleaſe that thy own child ſhould be offered to God in this Ordinance, without a word of prayer to God. They that conſider the great buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that lyes upon the hands of a Chriſtian, that high engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to which this Ordinance tyes, the manifold temptations
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:168215:46"/> that accompany a Chriſtian courſe cannot but confeſs, that their caſe calls for all mens prayers. 5. Note the ſcandal, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence that thou giveſt; the cenſure that thou leaveſt behind thee upon others that joyn in the duty; and on the other hand, the cenſure that thou beareſt from them, in thus forſaking of them; either Miniſter, and people do manifeſt their trifling folly, and ſo a taking of Gods Name in vain in the open Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation on the Lords day in his preſence, to wait upon ſuch an Ordinance that is unworthy of the honour of thy preſence; or elſe thou manifeſt much ſinful neglect in thy refuſal, or with drawing of thy ſelf. Thou canſt not but think their continuance is vain, or elſe muſt conclude thy own departure to be wicked. 6. Is there nothing of edification in this Ordinance? no Word to be heard, by which thou maieſt profit? doſt not thou here ſee Gods engagement to thy ſoul, and thy ſouls engagement unto God? Doth Baptiſme ſave, as the Arke of <hi>Noah,</hi> and is there nothing in it, whereby thou maieſt be benefited?</p>
                        <p>But here is objected, weakneſs of body, or haſte of buſineſs, that lyes upon them in that they can bear no longer.</p>
                        <p>Anſwer, 1. How is it, that theſe reaſons do not ſend thee away from other Ordinances, as well as barely from this? that thy weakneſs can bear, and thy buſineſs ſtay juſt to this time, that thy patience is beſpoke for this work: when the Miniſter intreats to ſtay this Sacrament, a man might think mens ears miſtook, and they thought he ſaid. Turn your backs, clap to your pew-doores, tumble down the ſtayrs, haſte, be gone, give your <hi>Amen</hi> to no more prayers, ſtay for no bleſſing; If theſe were the words, many could make no more haſte to be gone, then they do on requeſt to ſtay. 2. Let that text be well weighed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 46.9, 10. where order is given, both for the comming in, and going out of the publick aſſembly. The Prince may ordinarily ſpeak of as much buſineſs-intanglements to hinder as any other, by reaſon of the burden of his heavy employments, and yet he is to go in with the firſt, and ſtay in with the laſt; and his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is preſt, that it may be a precedent to others. Some are ſlow to come in, and as haſty to be gone; come as a Bear to the ſtake, and fly away as an Ape from a whip. They are for Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and from Ordinances, as a truantly boy is for ſchool, and from ſchool. Theſe have none of <hi>Jacobs</hi> thoughts, <hi>Surely God is in this place,</hi> Gen. 28.16. or that they have to deal with
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:168215:47"/> God in all the Ordinances of the day, otherwiſe they would riſe up early (as <hi>Job</hi> to his ſacrifices) to partake of them, and would not make any ſuch forward haſte to be quit of them.</p>
                        <p>And this reſpect, that it hath God for the Author, ſhould move us not barely to vouchſafe our preſence in the occaſional adminiſtration, which may be done gazingly, careleſſely, ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily;<note place="margin">An improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be made of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</note> But we ſhould make uſe of our own Baptiſme; being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted of God as a ſtanding Ordinance of his Church; we ſhould have other thoughts, then that as ſoon as it is paſt in the act, it is over in the uſe: we ſhould eye it all our dayes as our inlet into the ſociety of Saints, which is a greater honour then a Kings Coronation, and as a high engagement unto duty: to faith in the blood of Chriſt, to a death to ſin, and a reſurrection to righteouſneſs by power of the Spirit of Chriſt. Though it be low in the Ceremony, it is high in the obligation, tying us faſt to him whoſe name we bear by vertue of our baptiſme, our whole buſineſs ſhould be, that our conſcience may anſwer this obligation; as a ſeal put to, the promiſe for pardon of our ſin, and ſalvation. If Baptiſme ſaves by the reſurrection of Chriſt (as the Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21.) there ſhould be other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of it; were it aright conſidered, and duly improved, it would neither ſuffer ſin nor doubtings, it would not ſuffer any way of ſin, nor any prevalency of doubtings concerning our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſtate and condition.</p>

When they give a child in marriage, they do not neglect a wedding-feaſt, and ſuch civil appurtenances that uſually attend: but their great care, is about aſſurance for their livelihood: on this account counſel is retained, friends conſulted: But this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the day of their eſpouſal for viſible communion with Jeſus Chriſt, little thought is taken of the weight of that work, few prayers ſent up, or ſought for that purpoſe: did they think they were dedicated to God, they would be at care, and would not grudge pains to ſeek a bleſſing from God.</p>
                        <p>For the Lords Supper, that ſeemes often to have a little ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:168215:47"/> when that of Baptiſme hath none at all, being adminiſtred in times of mens growth, when the other was over in mens infancy, carrying terrour in the face of it by reaſon of thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite words of the Apoſtle upon the <hi>Corinthians</hi> prophanation of it: <hi>He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, is guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, and eateth and drinketh his own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> The examination called for upon addreſſe unto it, and thoſe liſts of judgements that are upon record upon the propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of it, <hi>many weak, and many ſick, and many ſleeping:</hi> And perhaps ſome reliques of ſuperſtition not yet wholly outed, ſince that time that a corporal preſence was believed, and the bread worſhipped: As is ſaid of ſome, that they receive ſo devoutly, as though God were in the bread; and they live as though there were no God in heaven. But if the Author and nature of this Sacrament were aright weighed, another reverence, a reverence beſeeming the glory of it, would be given it, which is not my buſineſs now to proſecute, being to ſpeak here of the general nature onely of Sacraments. Men would then be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that the whole of the Adminiſtration ſhould be carried on ſo as becomes the honour of the Ordinance, and would make it their buſineſs to promote a way that a due preparation might be made in fitting the communicants, and taking cognizance of them that come, that they may be able to diſcerne the Lords body, and ſo honour, and not prophane it. They would then take care to avoid unworthineſſe, leſt the Author of this Feaſt ſhould detect them, as the Maſter of the Feaſt did detect the man that came without his wedding-garment; we ſhould ſee more reverence in the duty, more careful conſciencious waiting upon the duty.</p>

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:168215:48"/> as we have heard: He entered the Covenant in his own name, and in the name of all them that were confederates with him: And he received Circumciſion the ſign of it: and they in their time reſpectively were alſo circumciſed: and from hence theſe Concluſions may be drawn.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>The Covenant-people of God, are the adaequate ſubject of the Sacraments; They, and they onely, have their right and intereſt in them</hi>

In New Teſtament times, it is as cleer, diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling and baptizing go together in Chriſts commiſſion: <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Nations, and baptize them,</hi> Matth. 28.19. as it did before the enlargement of that commiſſion, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.1. <hi>When the Lord knew that the Phariſees had heard that Jeſus made, and baptiſed more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples then John.</hi> Being made diſciples, we ſee they were baptized. And a diſciple of Chriſt, converted to the faith, and in profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion a Saint, was never doubted to be in Covenant with Chriſt, being of thoſe that belong to Chriſt and bear his Name, as the thing it ſelf ſpeaks, and the Evangeliſts compared ſhew, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.42. <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.41. Upon converſion there was no delay of Baptiſme, as appeares through the hiſtory of the <hi>Acts,</hi> Chap. 2.41. Chap. 8. ver. 12, 13.38. Chap. 9.18. Chap. 10.48. Chap. 16. ver. 15, 33. Chap. 18.8. Baptiſme inheriting the roome and honour of Circumciſion. As the Covenant gave immediate title to Circumciſion in the former diſpenſation: Now it gives the like title to Baptiſme. For the Lords Supper, it was never doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but Chriſtians made up into Churches by this Ordinance of Baptiſme, were inrighted in it; and the Apoſtle plainely ſhewes it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17. <hi>For we being many are one bread, and one body; for we are partakers of that one bread.</hi> And therefore <hi>Ravanellus in verbum Sacramentum,</hi> inquiring into the <hi>terminus cui,</hi> and <hi>cujus,</hi> for which they are appointed, ſaies, The <hi>terminus cui,</hi> the end for whom they ſerve, is <hi>ſoli foederati,</hi> alone perſons in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and then explaines himſelf, that<note n="b" place="margin">Inter foedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos autem Dei cenſentur om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes illi quiſunt in externa Eccleſiae Communione, et profitentur ſe in Chriſtum credere: ar vero, cum inter nos quidem poſſunt eſſe Hypocritae et impii, ideo Sacramenta in Eccleſia communia ſunt piis et impiis, ita tamen ut impii pro piis probabiliter habeantur.</note> 
                           <hi>All theſe are reckoned within the Covenant, that are in the external Communion of the Church; and profeſſe to beleeve in Chriſt. And ſeeing that among
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:168215:49"/> thoſe there may be many hypocrites and ungodly, therefore the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Church are common to the godly, and ungodly;</hi> quoting 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27, 29. and giving inſtance, that Circumciſion was thus conferred on <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> Gen. 17.23. on <hi>Hemor, Shichem,</hi> and the men of their Cities, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34.24. Baptiſme on <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> Acts 8.15. and the Lords Supper on <hi>Judas the traitour,</hi> Luke 22.21. When he ſaies that the Sacraments are common to the godly and wicked, he preſently inſerts indeed by way of parentheſis <hi>[So that the wicked are probably judged to be godly;]</hi> In which he ſeems to meane no other, but that their very profeſſion is the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, (as ſome ſay none can conclude any profeſſour of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to be ungodly; there may (ſay they) be ſome ſparkes of grace under aſhes, and ſeed in due time to ſprout out, yet lying under the clods, and not appearing) elſe he contradicts himſelf in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing ungodly and hypocrites aſunder, and the text alſo that he quotes; There was but little outward probability of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe in thoſe that ſo prophaned the Lords Supper, as in that chap. is held forth. And though few in their Treatiſes of the Sacraments in general, ſtand much on this particular, who they be that have their intereſt in theſe priviledges, nor do explicitely put it into the definition; yet we have it almoſt from every penne, and ſounding out of every pulpit; Are not Sacraments called ſeales, and that of Gods Covenant? are not arguments drawn in behalf of thoſe, that ſome would exclude from Sacrament priviledges, that they are <hi>Foederati,</hi> and therefore ſhould be <hi>Signati?</hi> They are in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and therefore are entitled to the ſeales of the Covenant, which is an argument of undenyable ſtrength. So farre as a man is veſted in a grant, ſo far he is entitled to the ſeal, for ratification of it, and may require it; why is there a phraſe borrowed from theſe proceedings among men, in caſe it be not ſo here as it is in their proceedings? Look into all <hi>Grants, Patents, Charters, Deeds, Leaſes, Bonds, Teſtaments,</hi> you ſhall ſtill ſee the Covenant, and ſeal of equall latitude.</p>
                        <p>Here indeed is ſomewhat objected which hath over and over been anſwered.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, That ſervants bought with money, and taken into <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> family, were to be circumciſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.12, 13. and ſo alſo into the family of others in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Exod. 12.44.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is ſtrangely brought to prove that men out of Covenant, ſhould be circumciſed, when the text ſaies, even
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:168215:50"/> of them, <hi>My Covenant ſhall be in their fleſh.</hi> Is the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God in the fleſh of thoſe that are out of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, It is no where enjoyned to compel them to Circumciſion, nor yet is there any Example of ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Every Maſters duty was (as <hi>Abrahams</hi> practice) to Catechize their families, and ſo, not to compel them, but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite them into Covenant. <hi>Cajetan,</hi>
                           <note n="c" place="margin">Cajetanus ergo qui neceſſitatem hanc ſuppoſuit, cum videret non convenire Sacramento qua tali, ut ab in vito ſuſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peretur, exiſtimavit invitos qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>dem fuiſſe circumciſos ſervos, ſed ad fidei profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem non fuiſſe adactos: notam vero iſtam fuiſſe, iſtis, etiam in vitis impreſſam quatenus erat ſignum Reipub. politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum ſeu externum, quo Iſraelitae ab ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is gentibus diſcernebantur.</note> as he is quoted by <hi>Rivet</hi> on <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.43, 44. (ſuppoſing that the words ſound towards a compulſion) underſtands, <hi>that ſervants were compelled to receive Circumciſion, but onely as a mark to diſtinguiſh them in a political way from other Nations; ſeeing it agrees not with a Sacrament as a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be received againſt heart.</hi> Rivets own thoughts about it may be brought into four heads. 1. That <hi>as to the cutting off the foreskin, and the ſmart ſuffered in it, it was no injuſtice in Maſters to compell them, ſeeing they were their Money.</hi> 2. That <hi>he beſt approves of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That hold that the Law of circumciſing of Proſelytes was on that condition, that they were willing to be circumciſed.</hi> 3. That <hi>Maſters ought to make it their buſineſſe to perſwade them; but not againſt heart to circumciſe them.</hi> 4. <hi>If that any think that a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity lay upon Maſters to circumciſe all ſervants, it is ſafeſt to be of Cajetans mind, to deny it to be any note of profeſſion of the Jewiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, It is objected on the other hand, that ſome in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant were denyed Circumciſion; as, 1. Infants before the 8th. day: But that is unworthy of any anſwer. A ſtated day for it, is not any denyall of it. 2. Females were not to be circumciſed, ſeeing the inſtitution is onely for the males. To which three things may be anſwered. 1. For thoſe that make uſe of this objection, they have authors of their own, namely, <hi>Walafridus Strabo de rebus Eccleſiaſticis</hi> (as he is cited by <hi>à Lapide</hi> on <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 17.) affirming that they were circumciſed. 2. The reaſon of their excluſion from any actuall participation, was their incapacity of it. And thirdly, they were circumciſed virtually, and ſo reputed of that number, as appeares in that they were admitted to the Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:168215:50"/> when the law was expreſſe, no uncircumciſed perſon muſt eat of it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48. And <hi>Samſon</hi> was charged that he took a wife of the uncircumciſed <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> Judg. 14.3. So that I ſay, a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting people of God, and they onely are entitled to the right of Sacraments; when they are given to a people out of Covenant, a ſeal is put to a blank, which muſt needs be an horrid prophanation of the ſeales of the Covenant of God. And when they are denied to thoſe in Covenant, (as not their right) they are injured from whom they are thus detay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>

                           <hi>God enters a Covenant exactly and properly ſo called with his people. A Covenant in the true nature of it, paſſeth between God and man:</hi> I took this for granted in the introduction into the Treatiſe of the Covenant of God entered with mankind, where in its proper place it might have been handled, ſuppoſing that there had been none that had denyed it; But ſince that time I have ſeen my miſtake, and among the many queſtions that have been moved and agitated about the Covenant, it is queſtioned whether there be any ſuch thing as a Covenant entered between God and any of the ſons of men upon earth? Commands and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are confeſt, but a Covenant is diſputed. The way to make it good, is, to prove from Scripture the name, and the thing; when theſe are proved, all is clear.<note place="margin">The word Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant proved.</note> The word we find in places above number, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.12. <hi>They ſtood that they might enter into Covenant with the Lord God.</hi> God is often put in mind by his people of his Covenant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.20. and he promiſes, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.42. <hi>to remember his Covenant.</hi> Theſe are then ſuch tranſactions between God and his people that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the name of a Covenant; when this cannot be d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And here I may deal liberally with any adverſary, and undertake to make proof not onely of all the eſſentials of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, but the uſual adjuncts: not onely all that makes up the nature, but all acceſſories uſually added to the ſolemnity of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants. For the eſſentials of a Covenant, or real properties, they are (as Mr. <hi>Burges</hi> ſaith) <hi>A mutual conſent and ſtipulation on both ſides.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">In the eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls of it.</note> Parties, conſent, and mutual engagement is all that is required to the being of a Covenant; when two parties agree, and either of them both have their conditions to make good, there is a Covenant or bargaine; ſee it exemplified in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral inſtances given, Treatiſe of the Covenant, Pag. 3. All of theſe we find in that one place, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.17, 18, 19. in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that God enters with his people, <hi>Thou haſt avouched the Lord this day to be thy God, and to walk in his wayes, and to keep his Statutes, and his Commandements, and his Judgements, and to hearken to his voyce: And the Lord hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people, as he hath promiſed thee, and that thou ſhouldeſt keep all his Commandements; And to make thee high above all Nations which he hath made, in praiſe, and in name, and in honour; and that thou maieſt be an holy people unto the Lord thy God,</hi> as he hath ſpoken. There are the Covenanters, <hi>God</hi> and <hi>his people.</hi> There is conſent on both parties. Thou haſt avouched, the Lord hath avouched. And there is a <hi>ſtipulation</hi> on both ſides; On Gods part, to make them high above all Nations, which he hath made, in praiſe, and in name, and in honour: On the peoples part, to keep all his Commandements, to be an holy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. There are Covenant-mercies from God to his people, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which of grace he engages himſelf; and there are Covenant-duties unto which man ſtands engaged, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.17, 18. <hi>But the mercie of the Lord is from everlaſting to everlaſting, upon them that fear him, and his righteouſneſs unto childrens children; to ſuch as keep his Covenant, and to thoſe that remember his Commandements.</hi> Let none ſay that this was a legal Covenant, in which man had his conditions, but is freed from all in the Covenant Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. Not to mention what I have elſewhere ſaid, Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:168215:51"/> of the Covenant, Pag. 102, 103, 104. Mr. <hi>Burges, Vindiciae legis,</hi> Pag. 224, 225. have abundantly manifeſted the contrary, and moſt amply of all others (that I have read) Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> in his Vindication, Pag. 60, to Pag. 70. where he delivers this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that <hi>the body of the Jewiſh Church was under the Covenant of grace,</hi> making it good with twelve arguments, and anſwering as many objections. Gods engagements in Goſpel-times none deny, mans reſtipulation is all the queſtion. And this is as clear in New Teſtament-times, as it was in the dayes of the Law; that of Chriſt fully holds it out, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.51. <hi>If any man keep my ſayings, he ſhall never ſee death.</hi> Chriſts engagement there, is to keep from death; and upon theſe termes, that man keep his ſayings: Here is a full tender of a Covenant, and Covenant-termes on Chriſts part, he that accepts of Chriſt as his Lord, and profeſſes to keep his ſayings, enters Covenant: he that hath in him ſuch an heart as God wiſhed in <hi>Iſrael, To feare him, and keep all his Commandements alwayes,</hi> Deut. 5.29. keeps Covenant. Goſpel-Preachers hold out Chriſt in Covenant, and they do not onely tender mercies, but engage to duties: <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31. <hi>Him hath God exalted to be a Prince, and a Saviour, to give repentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins:</hi> and this duty of repentance is in order to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of remiſſion of ſins, as we find from <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Repent and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out:</hi> when the duty of the Covenant is neglected, the mercy of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is loſt. This cauſed them in their Miniſtery, to be ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to urge men to it: <hi>Teſtifying both to the Jewes, and alſo to the Greeks, repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For the uſuall ſolemnities of a Covenant,<note place="margin">In the uſual acceſſories on ſolemnities.</note> Theſe are found in the tranſactions between God and his people, as well as the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of it. 1. Covenants uſed to be written for memorial for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, and ſo is the Covenant between God and man, as in Old, ſo in New Teſtament-times. <hi>Theſe things are written that you might believe, and that believing you may have everlaſting life,</hi> Joh. 20.31. 2. Covenants uſed to be confirmed with <hi>outward viſible ſignes,</hi> as the killing of beaſts, <hi>Jo.</hi> 15. <hi>Jer.</hi> 34 This was done in the old adminiſtration, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. Half of the blood was ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon the Altar, to denote Gods entering of Covenant, verſ. 6. The people alſo were ſprinkled with blood, to ſhew their voluntary entering into Covenant, verſ. 8. And in the new diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:168215:52"/> a new and unheard of ratification was uſed, the blood of the Mediatour of the Covenant, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.27, 28. This Cup is my blood in the New Teſtament which was ſhed for you, and for many, for the remiſſion of ſins. This latter is a plain alluſion to the former, in which you may find, 1. A three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold agreement. Either of both theſe were Covenants. 2. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of both theſe had their ratifications and confirmations. 3. Either of both were confirmed with blood. 2. A three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold difference. 1. The former was the Old Covenant, which was antiquated; This is the New. 2. The former was ratified, and ſanctified with the blood of beaſts: This is ratified and ſanctified in the blood of Chriſt. 3. That blood could never take away ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. This was ſhed many, for remiſſion of ſins.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Covenants uſe to be confirmed by <hi>ſeal:</hi> ſo is this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant between God and his people, as remaines to be ſpoken to. As the being of a Covenant is thus plentifully proved by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-teſtimony, ſo we might as amply prove it by arguments drawn from thence.<note place="margin">Arguments e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in the proper nature of it.</note> The Churches of Chriſt are eſpouſed unto Chriſt, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19, 20. And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteouſneſſe, and in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in loving kindneſs, and in mercies; I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulneſſe, and thou ſhalt know the Lord. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. I have eſpouſed you to one husband, that I may preſent you to Chriſt; and Spouſes are in Covenant with their Bridegroom. The Churches of Chriſt are married to Chriſt: <hi>Eſay</hi> 54.5. Thy maker is thine Husband, the Lord of hoſts is his Name, and thy Redeemer the holy One of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the God of the whole earth ſhall he be called. And wives are in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with their husbands. Their ſins againſt God are branded with the names of Adulteries, Whoredomes; and theſe are not barely diſobedience of a Command, or neglect of a favour, but breaches of Covenant. The Churches of Chriſt are ſervants of Chriſt, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. houſhold ſervants, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.19. and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are their Maſters by Covenant. Their ſins in this relation are not barely obſtinacy, ſtubbornneſs, or ingratitude, but they are charged with treachery, falſehood, dealing falſely in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and their hearts being not ſtedfaſt in Covenant. It is above me to conceive, how man can be a Covenant-breaker, not alone reſpective to man, but God as he is frequently charged,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:168215:52"/> when there hath paſt no Covenant between God and man. They may queſtion whether there were ever any ſuch thing as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in the world.</p>

                        <p>SEcondly, Whereas there is an uſual diſtinction (almoſt in all that write or ſpeak of the Covenant) of a double Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant between God and his people; one external, and the other internal; one paſſing outwardly, and the other inwardly kept and obſerved. Or (as Doctor <hi>Preſton</hi> expreſſeth it) a ſingle and a double Covenant, which I ſhall forbear to examine, ſeeing I know there is a right meaning; though I much doubt whether there be in the Reader a right underſtanding. My ſecond Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition ſhall be, that <hi>it is the external Covenant, not the inward, that exactly and properly is called by the name of a Covenant: and to which priviledges of Ordinances and title to Sacraments are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>next.</hi> This Propoſition (occaſioned by this received diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) is of three heads, which in caſe the Reader pleaſe, he may ſubdivide into three diſtinct Poſitions.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>The outward and not the inward Covenant is moſt exactly and properly called by the name of a Covenant,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The outward and not the inward Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> which I thus make good: That Covenant to which the definition of a Covenant doth belong, hath exactly and properly the nature of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, this none can deny: The definition ſets out the nature of the thing defined; But the definition moſt actly belongs to the outward Covenant, not to the inward, this is plain; An agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of parties on tearms and Propoſitions is the definition of a Covenant: Now the outward Covenant, is an agreement on tearms and Propoſitions, as elſewhere I have abundantly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. In that Covenant God engages himſelf to man for his happineſs; and man engages to faith and obedience. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Covenant hath no tearms or Propoſitions at all for man to make good upon account of his Covenanting: ſeeing the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the conditions of the Scripture-Covenant, is his very entrance into the inward Covenant. He that believes and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:168215:53"/> repents keeps Covenant, nothing more is expected of God, or promiſed by man: But believing and repenting is the firſt cloſing with God in Covenant according to them that ſpeak of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Covenant. A Covenant to perform conditions is a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant properly ſo called; But the outward Covenant, not the inward, is a Covenant to performe conditions, is plain: The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions in the inward Covenant are the Covenant.

                        <p n="1">1. Whether thoſe that carry this text to an unconditionate Covenant, and reſtrain it to that which they call the inward Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, do not make the Covenant in the time of the Law, and that in Goſpel-times eſſentially different, and conſequently ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make two Covenants of grace, diſtinct in kind; or thruſt thoſe under the Old Covenant out of all hope of ſalvation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all Interpreters, who make theſe Covenants one in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance?

                        <p n="2">2. Whether ſuch an Interpretation do not utterly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict New-Teſtament-light, which holds out the New Covenant in like latitude with the former, in which many are called, but few are choſen; and where conditions are as explicitely, and fully required, as in Old-Teſtament-diſpenſations?</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Whether when Scripture ſpeaks of things in oppoſition to mens erroneous conceits, and for a further explanation of them, and rectifying mens judgements in them, it do uſually lay down a full compleat and formal definition, to which nothing is to be added? or whether it doth not uſually ſupply that, in which men through miſtake were defective and ſhort? And whether thoſe texts, <hi>Eſay</hi> 58.6, 7. <hi>Is not this the faſt that I have choſen, to looſe the bands of wickedneſſe, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppreſſed go free, and that ye break every yoak? Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are caſt out into thy houſe, when thou ſeeſt the naked, that thou cover him, and that thou hide not thy ſelf from thy own fleſh?</hi> Jer. 22.15, 16. <hi>Did not thy father eat and drink, and do juſtice and judgement, and then it was well with him? He judged the cauſe of the poor and needy, and then it was well with him; was not this to know me, ſaith the Lord?</hi> Jam. 1.27. <hi>Pure Religion and undefiled before God and the

                           <note place="margin">Men enjoy pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and intereſt in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments upon account of the outward Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note>Thirdly, <hi>It is upon the account of the outward Covenant, and not the inward, that men enjoy priviledges of Ordinances, and intereſt in Sacraments;</hi> men that are ſo farre honoured as to an outward Covenant, have juſt title to theſe priviledges. It is in behalfe of the Jew outwardly that the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1. puts the queſtion; having ſo decried his condition, reſpective to the approbation of God, he objects, What advantage hath the Jew? what profit is there of Circumciſion? The Jew and Circumciſion are there one; A Jew outwardly, and Circumciſion in the fleſh go there in equal latitude. He that by nature is a Jew (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.15.) is of the Circumciſion; And to theſe the oracles of God are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; <hi>The inſtruments, deeds and evidencos of the Covenants,</hi> ſay the laſt Annotations. It was the priviledg of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Pſal. 147.19. Rom. 3. and then the priviledg of no other Nation; now it is the priviledg of all engraffed in their ſtead. This is confeſt even by a great part of thoſe that underſtand the inward Covenant (or Covenant keeping to acceptation,) almoſt whenſoever they mention a Covenant, in that they baptize infants upon Covenant grounds, all their infants that make a Covenant profeſſion, and that upon juſt warranty: Scripture honouring them (as I have ſhewen) with the name of children, and ſervants of God. It is further plain in reaſon. The outward Covenant muſt have privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges ſuitable to it, otherwiſe there is no manner of benefit or advantage of it. This priviledg of the Sacrament is ſuitable, being outward as the Covenant is outward; And it was ſufficiently clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the proofe of the main obſervation, where the Covenant people of God are affirmed to be the adaequate ſubject of the Sacraments, and all the Scriptures there urged, lead us to an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Covenant, or (as ſome ſpeak) to the intereſt of an outward adminiſtration of it; So that in caſe any will contend ſtill, that it is an inward Covenant that Scripture uſually mentions and honours
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:168215:54"/> with that title, yet being here in (as for a great part we ſeem) agreed, that priviledges of Sacraments are annext to the outward Covenant or outward adminiſtration, we have what we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</p>
                        <p>When this was almoſt ready for the Preſſe, Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie came forth, in which, pag 103. I am challenged for this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of an outward and inward Covenant, as though I had been the Author of it, when all know that it is a diſtinction, that of a long time among Divines hath been in common uſe; and in caſe it had not been commonly received, I ſhould have forborn the uſe of it. As I heard <hi>Mr. Ball</hi> once in diſcourſe ſay, that he denyed any ſuch diſtinction of an outward and an inward call to the Miniſtery, all calling being external, unleſſe the man called were a Prophet. That which men terme an inward call, being one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly qualifications fitting for the work: ſo I deny in exact propriety of ſpeech, that the inward Covenant is any Covenant, but the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of the ſoul unto that which the Covenant requires. And whereas Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is apparent that Mr.</hi> Blake <hi>distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth, ex parte Dei, between the outward and the inward Covenant; It is probable that he thus diſtributes them, from the bleſſings promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, whereof ſome are inward, and ſome outward; for though he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain not himſelf fully, yet I know no other ſenſe that it will bear.</hi> I thus diſtinguiſh them, to apply my ſelf to the Readers underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that hath been accuſtomed ſo to call them; and I ſay indeed, that men that barely Covenant, and keep not Covenant, have onely privlledges that are outward, they are viſible Church-members, and they have viſible Church-priviledges. And thoſe who anſwer to Covenant engagements (which uſually is called the inward Covenant) have priviledges both outward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. A Jew outwardly had outward priviledges, A Jew inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (that is, he that anſwered to his outward profeſſion, that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped God in his ſpirit) hath both thoſe that were outward and inward. It is there ſaid, <hi>It is evident that his outward Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant hath no ſeal; for it is a Covenant de ſigillis conferendis; If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it have a ſeal, it is either the ſame which is promiſed, or ſome other.</hi> What he meanes, when he ſaies, it is a Covenant <hi>de ſigillis conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> I am to learn; If he mean that the ſeal followes the Covenant, and is put to after the Covenant, ſo it is in all Covenants whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. He ſaies, <hi>they no where tell us what is the ſeal of their outward Covenant;</hi> me thinkes we had no need to tell what the ſeal of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:168215:55"/> that Covenant was, that the Jew entred; was it not Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? and did there not another follow, <hi>viz.</hi> the Paſſeover? Now I tell him, that Circumciſion and the Paſſeover were, and Baptiſme and the Lords Supper are ſeales of this Covenant. The Nation of the Jewes were in Covenant, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> (though he would, yet) muſt not deny they were in no inward Covenant; and yet they had theſe ſeales. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſayes, we are bound to give the ſeales to ſuch, Apolo. 88. <hi>Vocation which is effectual onely to bring men to an outward profeſſion of ſaving faith, is larger then election, and makes men ſuch, whom we are bound to baptize;</hi> And ſuch we ſay have right to Baptiſme. And to help Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> thoſe men that he ſaies the Church muſt baptize, though without right, we ſay are truely in Covenant, and have right; when he knowes what child he is to baptize, he knowes who we ſay are in Covenant, and have Covenant right to Baptiſme; ſo that a ſecond Covenant of which he ſpeakes to give right to a firſt, is a ſtrange fancy. But of this I ſhall have further occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

They ſtood equally entitled with the reſt of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to that Ordinance, yet there was a barre in the way, that they ſaw, to keep them back: They therefore plead their priviledg, and hold it as a matter of grievance, that there was any obſtacle in their way.

                        <p>For infants there can be no barre at all for their initiation.<note place="margin">There is no barre to the initiation of infants in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation on with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</note> They that hold that Sacraments conferre grace <hi>non ponenti obi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem,</hi> that is, upon all ſuch that put no barre or obſtacle to it, do withall conclude (and undenyably if they can make good their Poſition) that all infants in Baptiſme, are regenerate, ſeeing, they put no actuall barre, either by ſin or unbeliefe, to the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it for regeneration; ſo we that hold that infants are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate with their Parents, do conclude likewiſe, that they put no obſtacle or barre to their admiſſion to the ſign or ſeal. As there was no further qualification required in an infant for title to Circumciſion, then to be the ſon of an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> or one by Circumciſion joyned to <hi>Iſrael:</hi> ſo there was no barre by reaſon of uncleanneſſe, or want of previous purification mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned either in the command given to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. or in the Law given by <hi>Moſes, Levit.</hi> 12.

Thoſe that can find no barre in the child tendred to Baptiſme, but ſeek for one in the Parent, to withhold it from this initiating Ordinance, may here ſee that when the Parent was perſonally polluted, the child was clean; when the Parent might touch no hollowed thing, the child was yet to be circumciſed. And moral unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the Parent can have no more influence on the child, to indiſpoſe for this priviledge, then legal, when according to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Original ſin (though transfuſed by the Parent into the child) is no barre. In vain do they make the Parents actual ſins an obſtacle, which is terminated in the Parent as defiling the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but tranſmitting no blot to poſterity. It is a moſt un-Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural way in thoſe, that in their judgement are for Paedo bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, to inhibite the tender of infants, upon pretence of either
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:168215:58"/> their Parents ſin, or their want of Congregational memberſhip. And here that ſuppoſed great argument, to debarre the infants of ignorant and ſcandalous perſons from Baptiſme, may have an eaſie anſwer; <hi>Such Parents, if they were now to be Baptized, ought not to be Baptized;</hi> Ergo <hi>they cannot challenge it for their children; Baptiſme belongs primarily to the Parent.</hi> The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is here manifeſtly falſe, ſeeing ſuch Parents have unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably a fundamental firſt right, both to Baptiſme and the Lords Supper, in their reſpective order, by virtue of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the worſhip of God in Chriſt as their God, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to all falſe gods; and their profeſſion of the wayes of Chriſtianity, in oppoſition to all other wayes; though their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and ſcandal do prove a barre to their preſent admiſſion to either, and having this right, and being to be Baptized, their children with them are enrighted; and children putting in no barre, may be actually admitted. Priviledges in Church, and Common-Wealth, are <hi>ex traduce,</hi> and ſo are not crimes. In this I have delivered my ſelf, Treatiſe of the Covenant, <hi>chap.</hi> 46. as alſo in my Birth-priviledge, making good this poſition by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral arguments, <hi>That the children of all that by profeſſion are Chriſtian, are by virtue f Covenant-intereſt to be received into the Church by Baptiſme;</hi> Enlarging my ſelf in ſeveral particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, in ſuch whoſe ſeed ſome would debarre, which yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Scripture rules we ought to receive; Examining Mr. <hi>Firmins</hi> grounds to the contrary <hi>in his ſerious queſtion ſtated;</hi>

He muſt therefore give his Reader leave, from his own mouth, to believe that it is a very haſty birth, and what need there is that he ſhould yet lick it over, the work it ſelf will ſpeak. I little expected (I confeſſe) ſo unfair dealing from a man of his candour, he might eaſily have ſeen that all that I ſpeak to him in this thing there, is by way of Corollarie or inference drawn from that which by Scripture-teſtimony, and arguments in ſeveral foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters I had made good.

Before I come to give anſwer to his

                        </p>
                        <p>To give the Reader here an account, Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi> had framed this argument againſt the power of mediate Parents to conferre Baptiſme on poſterity; <hi>If that promiſe doth give this power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours, then though there were none to educate this child (for the ignorant and prophane Parents will not, but teach them how to breaks Covenant; predecſſours cannot, they are dead, and are not) yet we muſt ſeal to the child.</hi> Having explained my ſelf to avoid mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, I firſt anſwer, that Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi> himſelf here concludes ſuch a childs intereſt. In caſe he can be brought to break Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, he is intereſſed in the priviledges of the Covenant; to which he ſayes nothing at all, but either in haſte or prudence paſſeth it by, and dealing with Mr. <hi>Caudrey</hi> ſpeaks fully to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the ſtrength of it: <hi>Intereſt in the Covenant of the Goſpel</hi> (he ſaith, Pag. 4.) <hi>gives firſt right to Baptiſme.</hi> This child hath this intereſt, otherwiſe he can be in no capacity to break Covenant, he hath therefore this firſt right, and let Mr. <hi>F.</hi> ſee how he can deny an infant the ſecond. I add in the ſecond place, let him make it up into a formal argument, and then it runs thus: That child whoſe immediate Parents will not bring it up to the power of Godlineſs, hath no right to Baptiſme. Here his exception lyes, and therefore he demands, <hi>Where have I mentioned the power of Godlineſſe, as a requiſite in him who claimes Baptiſme? but to bring up a child in it, is harder matter.</hi> To which I reply, 1. That here is a ſtrange queſtion, ſeeing we were not ſpeaking to any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requiſite for Baptiſme, but after education, which was his excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 2. Though he mentions not education in the power of godlineſſe in words; yet in caſe his meaning be not ſo, his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment anſwers it ſelf; For the child of ſuch a parent that he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſhall infallibly (ſo farre as man can judge) have education in a away of Chriſtianity, ſo farre as to be of the Society of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Chriſtians, under the diſpenſation of thoſe Ordinances that are able to ſave the ſoul, and are called by the Apoſtle the power of God to ſalvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. He further addes, <hi>Sometimes your anſwer is a bare laying down your own judgement, with a ſimilitude added for illuſtration,</hi> quoting pag. 441. He addes,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:168215:59"/> 
                           <hi>we call for Scripture and reaſon, Similia ad pompam non ad pugnam.</hi> This that he relates unto was thus occaſioned: In his ſerious Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion ſtated, pag. 8. he ſaith, <hi>If the predeceſſour may by this promiſe give right to Baptiſme without the immediate parent, then I pray tell us how farre we may go for this predeceſſour? how many genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? where hath Gods Word limitted Miniſters? you may go to this predeceſſour, and no further.</hi> After that I had replied, that I knew but few that ſay the predeceſſour gives right, without the immediate parent, but all concurre in a joynt way to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate a Covenant intereſt; I there for further ſatisfaction of his Queſtion demand, in titles of honour and inheritance of Lands which men claim by deſcent from their Anceſtors, where is it that they will ſtay? adding that it will ſoon be anſwered, that they ſtay, when they can go no higher, to find out any other predeceſſor veſted in ſuch honour, or inheritance; and then I bring it home by applicatian of Scripture inſtances, full to our purpoſe. Some can make no claime at all from parents, they are the firſt of their houſe in honour or inheritance; and this was the caſe of <hi>Abraham,</hi> he had no intereſt in Covenant from <hi>Terah;</hi> ſuch was the caſe of the primitive converts; and ſuch is the caſe of the Indians, that now by a gracious providence are converted by the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Some can go no further then their immediate parents, they were the firſt in honour, or that gained an inheritance to their houſe; This was the caſe of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and thoſe children called by the Apoſtle, holy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. and will be the caſe of the children of Indian converts. Others can riſe to the third or fourth generation; others can go as high as the conqueſt; ſome can claime beyond the conqueſt, by Deeds without date: ſo it is with Chriſtians, they may go as high as Anceſtors have been in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. I here demand, whether there be not reaſon in this parallel, ſeeing Chriſtian priviledges (as I have proved at large, and he never denyed) are deſcendable from parent to child, as are honours and inheritances, and whether Scripture be wanting in that anſwer? I had proved at large, pag. 436. that mediate parents give this right: and I appeal now to the Reader, whether that queſtion of his, <hi>Where we may ſtay?</hi> hath not a ſufficient anſwer both from Scripture and reaſon, ſo that he might have ſpared his call for it?</p>
                        <p>I tell Mr. <hi>F.</hi> that his firſt argument brought for the excluſion of infants of ignorant and ſcaudalous perſons from Baptiſme
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:168215:59"/> managed in the way that he doth, was Mr. <hi>Blackwoods</hi> argument before him, to debarre all Infants from Baptiſme, putting his own <hi>Medium</hi> into Syllogiſticall forme againſt him, with equall force concluding againſt all Infant Baptiſme, which he ſaies, <hi>Sir, is no clever way of diſputation,</hi> pag. 53. Then I am to learn how to diſpute cleverly, if I may not deal by retortion againſt a man, with his own weapon: did not Chriſt diſpute in a clever way with the Phariſees, when they charged him to caſt out devills by <hi>Beelzebub?</hi> anſwering them, <hi>By whom then do your children caſt them out?</hi> Matth. 12.27. He anſweres for himſelf, <hi>that he never ſaw any thing of</hi> Mr. <hi>Blackwoods,</hi> and I never had it in my thoughts to charge him with borrowing from him, but onely to ſhew him that either his arguments might have an anſwer, or elſe he muſt deny Baptiſme to all Infants, which is againſt both his own judgement, and practice. He tells me that Mr. <hi>Johnſon hath anſwered the argument before me, and I in his words, though he ſaies, it may be I ſaw him not,</hi> which to me is ſtrange, that we ſhould ſo hit in one, I having ſeen no more of Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> then he hath done of Mr. <hi>Blackwood;</hi> but it is worth the obſerving how he goes about to avoid it, as turned againſt himſelf; For he knew well that I brought it not as an argument <hi>ad rem,</hi> (for he ſaies, I have anſwered it) but <hi>ad hominem.</hi> His argument is this, pag. 18. of his Serious queſtion, <hi>Such perſons as de jure ought, and de facto are excluded by godly Miniſters from the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ought alſo to be excluded from their childrens Baptiſme: But ſuch perſons as the queſtion mentions, de jure ought, and de facto are excluded from the Lords Supper:</hi> Ergo. The Major he proves thus, <hi>If Baptiſme doth ſeal to the ſame Covenant, which the Lords Supper doth, and doth ſignifie and ſeal as great bleſſings and priviledges, as the Lords Supper doth, then thoſe who are excluded from the Lords Supper, ought alſo to be excluded from their childrens Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: But the antecedent is true: Ergo the conſequent is true.</hi> This in Mr. <hi>Blackwoods</hi> behalfe I thus urge againſt him, If Baptiſme doth ſeal to the ſame Covenant, which the Lords Supper doth, and doth ſignifie and ſeal, as great bleſſings, and priviledges as the Lords Supper doth, then thoſe that are excluded from the Lords Supper ought alſo to be excluded from Baptiſme: But all Infants are excluded from the Lords Supper <hi>eo nomine</hi> becauſe they are Infants; and therefore they are to be excluded from Baptiſme. Further adding, when Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi> hath given a fair, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:168215:60"/> a full anſwer to this Syllogiſme, he may eaſily fit it to his own, to give like ſatisfaction.</p>
                        <p>All his anſwer is, <hi>My argument is not hurt at all, though the parent may be ſuſpended for a time, what is this to the ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of three parts of a Church, ſix or ten yeares together, and never proceed further?</hi> And I ſay, what is this to the purpoſe? Though parents be ſuſpended all their daies, whether juſtly, or injuriouſly, root and branch are not therefore under ſuſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                        <p>Words of mine, pag. 426, 424. he challenges: <hi>Infants of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents that are nomine tenus Chriſtians have right to Baptiſme, if they profeſſe the worſhip of the true God, though nothing more of a Chriſtian be in them.</hi> In which how much my words are curtail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for haſte, I leave to the Reader, by comparing to find out.</p>
                        <p>For anſwer, He ſpeakes firſt by way of conceſſion, <hi>I make no queſtion but many ſuch nominal ones a Miniſter may baptize, and their children, though they have not truth of grace in them;</hi> and goes on, <hi>But I perceive your ſcope is to ſpread the Word very large, and that directly oppoſite to my queſtion; If they will ſay they are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, bear the Name of Chriſt, own his worſhip (though it be but from the cuſtome of the Nation, others do ſo, and ſo do they) though their courſe and frame of converſation be like the infidels, or worſe, yet they are Chriſtians nomine tenus, hence we muſt baptize if they have but fides, no matter for obſervation.</hi> The great fault is, it ſeemes, that I preſume to go oppoſite to his queſtion, which I muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly acknowledge; but ſeeing I am allowed to baptize both parent and child, where there is no truth of grace in the parent, and yet am chidden for being too large, I demand when I muſt ſtay? in what latitude I may walk? Men of the Congregational way are wont to limit me to parents one or both of the truth of grace, and will allow none but beleevers children; If juſtifying faith be not in the parent, no baptiſmal water ſhall come on the child. All other Chriſtians from the beginning of Chriſtianity (thoſe excepted that as of yeſterday have oppoſed infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme) look upon them under what notion you will, have allowed to go as farre as profeſſion of Chriſtianity. Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi> that will be larger then the one, and narrower then the other, muſt tell us where we muſt fix. He hath my rule to except againſt, I have not his to challenge. To let me underſtand my error in being
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:168215:60"/> too large, he demands, <hi>But, Sir, I pray what if they be heretical about the natures of Chriſt, as of old ſome deny the humanity of Chriſt, and ſome the Deity of Chriſt?</hi> and then proceeds to further inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. To which I firſt anſwer, Perhaps he may find ſome called Chriſtians, that it is a contradiction <hi>in adjecto</hi> to name them ſo, ſuch that receive not the Goſpel at all, but profeſſedly abhorre it. If any ſuch are intended, I ſhall ſay my meaning is known. They that are no Turkes, Infidels, Pagans, but in oppoſition to them of the faith, worſhip, and way, that is Chriſtian. Secondly, For the Heretiques inſtanced in, ſuch as were of old, Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi> being ſo well verſt in the way of antiquity, I wiſh him to enquire what the Orthodox thought in thoſe times of their Baptiſme? Did they rebaptize thoſe that had received their Baptiſme? Did they deny their infants Baptiſme? They were to be trained to hear that Word that was able to convince this error: And how much worſe, reſpective to ſalvation, were theſe tenents then that of the denyall of the reſurrection? yet the Infants of ſom ſuch were circumciſed, (as I have ſhewen) and of others baptized. He goes on: <hi>What if they think Chriſt was a Woman?</hi> as (he ſaies) <hi>he hath given inſtance in one;</hi> And indeed a wild one, of one who had a prayer where this was often repeated, that <hi>Jeſus was her name;</hi> perhaps he was a Welſh-man, and then (according to their dialect) <hi>her</hi> is the Maſculine gender. This indeed were an error, full of folly, but not of ſuch danger, for two reaſons. 1. Chriſt were yet of mankind, and had taken our nature, had he been of that ſex. 2. It were not likely that he ſhould make over ſuch an opinion to his poſterity: He leaves hereſy, (which he might have ſpared, ſuch ſhunne our Congregations) and falls to inſtance in ignorance <hi>What if he knew not whether he was God or man, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? what: if ten Gods?</hi> with abundance ſuch ſtuffe. I ſay, the caſe of ſuch is ſad, &amp; more ſad in the degree, then I have met with any of the uſe of reaſon, and in capacity for marriage ſociety. I wiſh from my ſoul that all meanes were ſought that theſe blind might ſee; yet as long as God is not hereby provoked to remove our Candleſtick, but light ſtill ſhines in our Horizon, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God being not yet removed; ſo that when the parent is blind, the child may ſee, as I have known many happy experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, yea, the ignorant parents glorying in it. There is not cauſe that we ſhould be more ſevere then the Lord himſelf, as to thruſt out their poſterity from the ſociety of the Lords people. This
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:168215:61"/> were to provoke them to ſhut their eyes, and not to open them to receive the light that ſhines about them; I think it were to exceed in our zeal againſt ignorance, as farre as the diſciples did againſt the <hi>Samaritanes,</hi> when they would have <hi>fire to come down from heaven to conſume them,</hi> Luke. 9.54. I had inſtanced in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in Church-members, not onely among the Jewes, but Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as the <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That I know no more then the Apoſtle tells me, and he ſaies it was want of the knowledge of God. 2. I demand, will you allow me to baptize the children of thoſe that I find not equalling ſuch in ignorance that you mention, <hi>viz.</hi> the children of all that know that God is one, and the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements tenne? 2. He demands, <hi>Was not Paul as true to his work as Abraham or the Jewes were to be in admitting to Circumciſion? which I mention,</hi> pag. 445. To which I ſay, I do not think that the admiſſion of all was <hi>Pauls</hi> work, and that many were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, after he left them, before he wrote this Epiſtle to them. 2. I know he admitted few among them, their admiſſion was by Baptiſme; and how many, or (if you will) how few he baptized in <hi>Corinth,</hi> you may learn from himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.14, 16. 3. He ſaies, <hi>I have found ſo much ignorance that the perſons deſerved ſhame, but yet dared not to keep them from the Lords Supper, becauſe I found ſuch a work on their heart, though they could not expreſſe it in a definition.</hi> To which I ſay, that I find ſo much ignorance in my ſelf that deſerves ſhame, and ſuch that may not be able to expreſſe the thing that might be in queſtion, might paſſe with me, for knowing men; <hi>Periti eſt artificis definire;</hi> But were they ſuch that you could ſay to their ſhame, that they had not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God? and yet durſt you not exclude them from the Lords Supper? He tells us of many ſad inſtances of ignorance in fathers, upon which he refuſeth to give admiſſion to infants; But were it granted that ſuch, as to all priviledges were meer hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, as it was with thoſe in <hi>Corinth</hi> mentioned by the Apoſtle that were joyned in marriage with believers, and their ignorance
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:168215:61"/> not onely groſſe, but total, and in all reſpects to be reckoned among thoſe that were without God in the world (as I ſhall not yeeld as long as the candleſtick is not removed,) yet I do not hear that he makes any enquiry after the mothers of thoſe infants; that he takes the paines to go to them in Child-bed, to demand any account of their proficiency: perhaps they might give as good an account, as ſome that he ſaies he durſt not keep from the Lords Table. And then as in the Apoſtles judgement, they ſanctifie their husbands in unbelief, as to the producing of an holy ſeed, being no profeſſed infidels, but in name Chriſtians: So according to his own judgement, as to that end, they ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy their husbands in ignorance, being ſo far knowing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>

When they heare of it, they hear of a field with tares and wheat, of a draw-net with fiſh of all ſorts; They live to ſee flouriſhing fields of pure wheat, full nets of fiſhes that are onely good; being told that many are called but few choſen, they yet ſee myriads of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands called and all choſen.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:168215:62"/> ones; and that this ſoul-complexion is the ſame in the whole body, members having received the ſame Spirit of Adoption, own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and experiencing the ſame grace of God.</hi> But it is plain that Chriſt did neither ſee, nor foreſee any ſuch purity of complexion, nor can they that look upon Primitive Churches in the glaſſe of Scriptures ſee any more then Chriſt did diſcover. Thoſe words of <hi>Luke,</hi> Act. 15.3. <hi>And being brought on their way by the Church, they paſſed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the converſion of the Gentiles, and they cauſed great joy unto all the brethren,</hi> is made a fundamental ground-work of this building of ſuch glory, as though all converſion by the Word were attended by the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging work of the Spirit; which happy gloſſe (in caſe it would hold) would turne all the grounds in the parable into good ground, and a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nvert or proſelyte in an hiſtorical narrative, would ever be the ſame with elect or regenerate. But the words going before, and following theſe (if they may be but taken in) will ſerve to ſpoil all this ſuppoſed glory and purity. A ſect riſeth up and teacheth the Brethren, that <hi>except they be circumciſed after the manner of Moſes they cannot be ſaved,</hi> and what manner of men they were, and how their Doctrine took, we may read in <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles to the <hi>Philippians, Coloſſians,</hi> and eſpecially in that to the Churches of <hi>Galatia;</hi> it almoſt wrought to the apoſtatizing of thoſe Churches from the faith of Chriſt to another Goſpel, If ever theſe were one homogeneal body, reſpective to ſoul com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion; an abundant proof is given in againſt the Saints perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance and for their falling from grace, <hi>Paul</hi> was not ſo ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured with their beauty, when he tells them that <hi>he is afraid of them, and travells again in birth of them.</hi> And whether he had ſuch high thoughts of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> let ſundry paſſages in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to them witneſſe.

So that it is plain, that in primitive times Jewes and Pagans, being wrought upon (by the Word heard, and miracles ſeen) to make profeſſion of, and engage to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith and life, were upon that account received: of which, as ſome had hearts ſincere towards Chriſt, ſo many were otherwiſe. Through the whole Scripture there is no demurre put to the Baptiſme of any who made profeſſion of the Name of Chriſt, ſave <hi>Saul,</hi> concerning whom <hi>Ananias,</hi> (being warned of God to go to him, and conferre ſight upon him, being ſtruck blind)
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:168215:63"/> objects, <hi>the evil that he had done to the Saints at Hieruſalem; and that he had at preſent, authority from the Chief Prieſts, to bind all that called on the Name of Chriſt,</hi> Acts 9.13, 14. And when he afterwards aſſayed to joyn himſelf to the diſciples that were at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> they were all (upon that account) afraid of him. Neither <hi>Ananias</hi> at <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> nor the Church at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> did put his ſincerity in grace to the queſtion, upon that account they might have challenged thouſands of others; But they fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he onely pretended converſion, upon a deſign to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his way of perſecution. Let Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> from <hi>New England</hi> in this particular be heard, who laies down this concluſion, That <hi>the Church in dispenſing an enjoyned initiatory ſeal of the Covenant of grace, looketh into viſibility of interest in the Covenant to guide her in the application thereof, nor is the ſaving intereſt of the perſons her rule by which ſhe is to proceed.</hi> There, we find in the affirmative, what that is that muſt lead, <hi>viz. viſibility of intereſt in the Covenant,</hi> and in the negative, what muſt not lead, and that is, <hi>ſaving intereſt in the Covenant.</hi> And viſibility of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt is certainly theirs, who profeſſe Chriſt, engage for Chriſt, and avouch themſelves to be for him, unleſſe we will utterly confound Covenant entring, and Covenant keeping, which Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo carefully diſtinguiſhes. I know Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi> in his reply to Mr. <hi>Caudry</hi> ſpeaking of Scandalous perſons,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>F.</hi> appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix as to the admiſſion of men of years examined.</note> pag. 4. ſaith, <hi>According to our Congregational principles, that which gives a man the firſt right to a Sacrament, viz. his intereſt in the Covenant of the Goſpel, this man hath not; for he doth viſibly declare to the Churches, that he hath no intereſt in the Covenant.</hi> That intereſt in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Goſpell gives a man the firſt right to a Sacrament, we willingly imbrace; but that cenſure of ſcandalous perſons, that they viſibly declare to the Churches, that they have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Covenant, we muſt reject, as evidently contrary to Scripture principles. <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of whom <hi>Moſes</hi> gave that teſtimony, that <hi>the Lord had not given them an heart to perceive, and eyes to ſee, or eares to hear,</hi> ſpeaking of the generality of them, had ſome that might have been judged ſcandalous, yet they all of them even then entred Covenant with God, <hi>Captaines of their tribes, Elders, Officers, even all the men of Iſrael, from the hewer of wood, to the drawer of water,</hi> Deut. 29.10, 11. Thoſe that God owns as his people in Covenant, and calls by the name of his people, I ſhall take to have intereſt in the Covenant, though thouſands

Chap. 6.26. Chap. 8.11. The Vineyard of the Lord conſiſts of a people in viſible Covenant, yet with theſe we find not a few ſcandals and ſcandalous ones, as <hi>Iſay</hi> 5. is manifeſt; ſee, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.6, 12. <hi>My people are deſtroyed for lack of knowledg: my people aske counſel at their ſtockes and their ſtaffe, declareth unto them, for the ſpirit of whoredome hath cauſed them to erre, and they have gone a whoring from under their God.</hi> Shall we ſay they were not Gods people, or ſhall we ſay that theſe were no ſcandals? to put all out of queſtion, the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.2, 3. that intereſt in the Covenant pertaines to all <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the fleſh, neither is it any otherwiſe in Goſpel times, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. <hi>If any man that is called a brother, be a fornicator, or Covetous, or an Idolater, or a rayler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner,</hi> &amp;c. he that is called a brother is viſibly in Covenant, but ſuch a one (we ſee) may be ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. The ſeven Golden Candleſticks are the ſeven Churches, amidſt which Chriſt walkes, and whether there were not ſcandals among theſe, read the Epiſtles to them. If viſible intereſt in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant give a firſt right, then theſe undoubtedly may claime it, their firſt right (according to the forementioned principle) is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted; and for actuall admiſſion (as well as the firſt right) to the Sacrament of initiation, let the ſame Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> ſpeak; <hi>John Baptiſt did, and lawfully might baptize thoſe multitudes, albeit in the general he knew that many, yea, moſt of them would prove falſe, and frothy</hi> quoting, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>Albeit, we may think in the general that to be ſure in all viſible Churches there will be ſome veſſels of diſhonour ſometimes, yet Miniſters which are the Churches as well as Chriſts ſervants, are not therefore to refuſe to diſpenſe Church ordinances ſince, they are in the face of the Church ſuch utenſills as the Lord may have and hath need of. Hence the Apoſtles (which are extraordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons knew the guile of perſons ſecret from the Church, witneſſe, that act againſt Ananias and Sapphira,</hi> Acts 5.1; &amp;c.) <hi>yet in adminiſtring the Church ſeal of Baptiſme they refuſed not Ananias and Sapphira
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:168215:64"/> no, nor Simon Magnus,</hi> Acts 8. <hi>Nor thouſands of other of the Jewes, amongſt whom how many proved falſe?</hi> Acts 2.41. <hi>and</hi> 4.1, 2, 3, 4. compared. 21.20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 28, 30, 31, 36. <hi>and</hi> 22.20, 22 <hi>and</hi> 23.12, 13. <hi>witneſſe.</hi> So that we ſee Scripture gives prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents (if we judge them ſafe to follow) of a very facile admiſſion of thoſe that profeſſe and manifeſt their willingneſſe to engage in Chriſtian waies.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi> ſaies, <hi>If a bare profeſſion of faith in Chriſt be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make a member of a Church, then no perſon can be juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated out of a Church, for the vileſt ſinnes or hereſies, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he doth but hold this profeſſion of his faith: The conſequence is cleere, the perſon is the ſame now, which he was when you took him into the Church.</hi> To this I have anſwered, pag. 449. The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is cleerly erroneous, for he made a profeſſion of his faith and not of his ſin. To this Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi> replyes, <hi>Then it ſeemes the man muſt profeſſe his ſin with his own mouth, as his faith, though Mr.</hi> Blake <hi>knowes he is a ranter, &amp;c. The members of the Church witneſſe it, yet becauſe the mans own mouth doth not profeſſe it, you admit him.</hi> I deſire to know where witneſſes were called in for this purpoſe to ſpeake what they had to ſay againſt ſuch and ſuch a mans admiſſion to Baptiſme, as now by an inſtrument affixt on the door of the publique place of meeting men are called to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, (in caſe they have any thing to ſpeak) againſt Miniſters or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination. Had <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> nothing againſt the Jaylour at <hi>Philippi?</hi> who was ſo ſerviceable to thoſe in power, that he thruſt them into the inward priſon, and made their feet faſt in the ſtockes, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.24. And wheras our author ſaies elſewhere, that <hi>there was a legal work on his conſcience,</hi> ſo there is many a time on mariners in a ſea ſtorm, which a calme will ſuddenly quiet. Can he imagine that the lives of all the people, even the Publicanes and harlots that <hi>John</hi> baptized (<hi>Matth.</hi> 21.31. Luke 7.29. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared) were ſo inoffenſive, that none could ſay black to their eye? whatſoever <hi>John</hi> knew (in caſe they had been called in and heard,) ſome could have ſaid ſomewhat againſt theſe Publicanes and harlots, and yet even theſe were admitted. As to that which followes, <hi>Then, Sir, though you know the ſame abominations after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and your members teſtifie it, witneſſes come in you muſt not cast him out, unleſſe he will profeſſe it.</hi> Though he is pleaſed to ſay that this argument will coſt me more then two lines, before it be anſwered, yet a few words will ſhew that it is a meer <hi>non
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:168215:64"/> ſequitur.</hi> If a man make it his requeſt, upon the fame that he hath heard, and the good that he hath ſeen in Mr. <hi>Firmins</hi> Family, to be admitted to ſerve him in it, confeſſing his wayes to have been bad, but now profeſſes that he is reſolved upon a new way, and in order to it, deſires to be received into ſuch a Society, where godlineſſe may be learnt, may not he now admit him? and may he not afterwards upon breach of this engagement diſmiſſe him? I will averre my ſimilitude to be fit, yet I confeſſe it is not full; for when Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi> hath diſmiſſed this ſervant, and put him out of doores, he hath now no more relation to him. But when a man upon profeſſion to be for God, is once in Covenant, though his wickedneſſe deſerves that the priviledges of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhould be denyed, yet he is ſtill in Covenant, though under breach of Covenant, and ſtands related to the Church of God in title, otherwiſe, upon his repentance he muſt have a new ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion by Baptiſme. The Church, I ſay, may receive a man upon engagement of amendment, (which muſt be done in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme) to be baptized, and upon his return to wickedneſſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate him: His profeſſion gives him right to Baptiſme, and his ſin deſerves excommunication. He tells us, Though we read not that <hi>Philip</hi> required repentance, yet others did: But did they ſo require it, as in reality to precede baptiſme? Or were they ſatisfied with a profeſſion of it? If they ſo required it as in reality to precede, they then muſt give a day over to give evidence of it; and whether this was the manner in <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſme, in <hi>Philips,</hi> or the Apoſtles, let adverſaries be Judges.</p>
                        <p>I cannot tell what ſhould move Mr. <hi>F.</hi> when he had given me thanks, pag. 54. for my courteous handling of him without ſcorn, to adde in the next page, <hi>Sir, I thought Chriſtianity had taken in the heart, and outward converſation as well as the head; a real Chriſtian is one united to Chriſt, ſound in the doctrine concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt, and walking as Chriſt did [we ſuppoſe an old Adam]. Let him who is a nominal Chriſtian appear like one, though he be not real.</hi> And I do think that it is little below a ſcorn, to bear the world in hand that I think otherwiſe; what have I ſaid for him to Sir me in this particular? perhaps becauſe I ſomewhere ſpeak of a profeſſion of faith, not mentioning repentance; ſo he may challenge <hi>Philip</hi> to be defective, who when the <hi>Eunuch</hi> deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>What doth hinder me to be baptized?</hi> anſwered, <hi>If thou belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:168215:65"/> with all thine heart thou mayeſt,</hi> Act. 8.37. And <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> likewiſe, who when the <hi>Jaylour</hi> ask'd, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> anſwered as we know, <hi>Believe in the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved, and thine houſhold;</hi> Nay, will not the ſame charge fall upon the head of our Saviour himſelf, who in his Commiſſion to the Apoſtles, ſaith, <hi>He that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved?</hi> None of theſe mention repentance; what can be ſaid for them, will excuſe me: I am ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt repentance in a Chriſtian, that I expect ſome will think that I have ſaid too much for the neceſſity of it, and put too high an honour upon it. He proceeds farther, and ſaith, <hi>Let us view the Scripture in adminiſtration of Baptiſme,</hi> Mar. 4. <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of Repentance, that is more then Faith.</hi> More explicitely, but no more implicitely. Faith takes Chriſt to give repentance, as well as a Saviour to give remiſſion of ſins. <hi>They confeſſed their ſins,</hi> ſaith he. 1. Some will have it to imply no verbal confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but virtual, coming for baptiſme for remiſſion of ſins, it was an acknowledgment that they were guilty; which gloſſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſtrong probability with it, in regard of the multitude, that in ſo ſhort a ſpace were baptized. 2. I require more, an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to leave ſin, which their taking upon them the Name of Chriſt doth imply, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Let every one that nameth the Name of Christ depart from iniquity.</hi> He goes on, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37, 38. <hi>Firſt Jewes ſo had knowledge not ſo ignorant as ours</hi> I believe. The Reader may believe the contrary, till he ſee ſome proof. <hi>Secondly, having a legal work by the power of the Word:</hi> They that had crucified Chriſt as a blaſphemer, deceiver, muſt needs have ſome work upon them before they would take him profeſſedly for a Saviour. <hi>Thirdly, Receiving the Word;</hi> That implies no more then giving credit to what the Apoſtle ſpake, that Jeſus whom they had crucified was Lord and Chriſt. <hi>Fourthly, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting they are baptized, this is more ſtill.</hi> And more then is expreſt in the Text. Baptiſme in his Name doth indeed imply, that now they repented that they had crucified him, otherwiſe, we read not of their repentance: <hi>Acts</hi> 8. (ſaith he) <hi>though there is not mention made of the Samaritans repentance, who were apoſtatized from the Jewes, but laid claim to the Patriarchs,</hi> Joh. 4.20. <hi>expected Chriſt,</hi> verſe 25. <hi>worſhipped God,</hi> Ezra 4.2. <hi>yet that Philip ſhould know them to be ſo abominable in converſation, and yet baptize them, that is to be proved, ſince that others required repentance.</hi> He may
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:168215:65"/> adde to theſe Elogies of the <hi>Samaritanes, that they worſhipped they knew not what,</hi> Joh 4.22. and that they bore that good will to the people of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> that when <hi>they perceived Chriſt with his Diſciples to be for Hieruſalem</hi> at the time of the Paſſeover, they would not let them have meat for money, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.51, 52. And I confeſſe, as much of repentance in them, as was required in any to the acceptation of Baptiſme, namely, a renuntiation of their falſe way, and a profeſſed acceptation of the tender of the Goſpel. There yet followes, <hi>If this be not a giving of holy things to dogs, (which</hi> Tertullian <hi>and</hi> Auſtin <hi>give warning of even in baptizing) I know not what is; Let a man be a notorious Ranter, Sodomite, Scoffer at godlineſſe, drunkard, no matter what; this is known and proved, yet a Chriſtian nomine tenus, therefore you muſt baptize him.</hi> Where I pray do I ſpeak of baptizing any that is <hi>nomine tenus</hi> a Chriſtian? My opinion is, that ſuch that have the name Chriſtian, are baptized already, I hope ſuch contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ſeldom come from my pen. That theſe are no words of mine, my adverſary will acknowledge, and that any ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence can be gathered from any thing that I have ſaid, that I muſt baptize perſons of this quality already baptized, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der can ſcarce imagine; this I impute to haſte or paſſion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting or obſtructing the uſe of reaſon. He muſt then blot out <hi>Chriſtian nomine tenus,</hi> and inſert inſtead of it, <hi>an Heathen, Jew or Pagan</hi> (otherwiſe he is already a baptized perſon, and in incapacity for baptiſme) by the power of the Word preached, brought to renounce his way of Paganiſme, Judaiſme: and to profeſſe and engage to a Chriſtian faith and converſation. Theſe are the men that I would have baptized, and if we muſt account them to be <hi>dogs, and ſwine,</hi> all Scripture-baptizers are within the laſh, they have given baptiſme to them. That <hi>repentance as well as faith was required in baptiſme, appeares</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by the ages following the Apoſtles, yea, and in the Apoſtles time likewiſe.</hi> A profeſſion of both was indeed required, they that renounced heathen worſhip, renounced heathen converſation with it; They engaged to a Chriſtian faith, and they engaged to a Chriſtian converſation. Mr. <hi>F.</hi> addes, <hi>For thoſe who would live in their luſts, they deferred their baptiſme, knowing what that required.</hi> I have read of the deferring of baptiſme in thoſe times, and the reaſons aſſigned, why they put it off: But I have not met with this reaſon. Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> in his defence of Infant-Baptiſme
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:168215:66"/> hath given many reaſons, why ſome put off baptiſme. Some to be baptized at the age that Chriſt was baptized; Some to be baptized in the river where he was baptized; Some to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by ſome ſpecial Biſhop of eminent place; Some, (which it ſeems was moſt common) becauſe they conceived, that it takes away all ſin, and therefore they would have it delayed, till ſin was well over, for which he quotes many authorities: <hi>Tertullian</hi> (it appears) would have it delayed upon this ground, ſeeing he would not have unmarried perſons baptized, but to ſtay till luſt were extinguiſhed; and diſſwading from baptiſme in younger years, he hath theſe words, <hi>Quid feſtinat innocens aetas ad remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionem peccatorum?</hi> de baptiſ. cap. 18. Yet perhaps ſome might delay it upon the account that he mentions, though he quotes no authority for it, but that <hi>Tertullian and Nazianzen</hi> intimate it, one of whom was for delaying of baptiſme in the place quoted, the other againſt it, as I find him cited. But in caſe any did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay it upon the grounds by him mentioned, might it not be their fault that did adminiſter it? in keeping the door too narrow, as well as their ſin who put off the time of it, ſeeing Mr. <hi>F.</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf complains of the rigour of ſome in <hi>New-England,</hi> in hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men off from entrance into Church-fellowſhip, by that door which is ſet up in the room and place of baptiſme.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Firmin,</hi> as well in his Serious queſtion ſtated, as in his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix againſt me, vouches many authorities, firſt <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> inſtancing in his margine <hi>Lond. Min. Jus Div</hi> pag. 115. But in my book that page hath no ſuch thing; <hi>Gilleſpies Aarons Rod</hi> quoting many pages, I can recompence him in ſetting up ſome of the Congregational way againſt him. Mr. <hi>Gilleſp.</hi> will not have a known unregenerate man baptized; But Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> ſaith, <hi>John did and might lawfully baptize thoſe multitudes, albeit in the general he knew that many, yea, moſt of them would prove falſe and frothy;</hi> And makes <hi>viſibility of intereſt in the Covenant the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches guide in application of Baptiſme,</hi> pag. 52. And how large a viſibility of intereſt is, is cleer, and I have already ſhewen, Let his words before quoted be conſidered; and to theſe adde that which he hath, pag. 54, 55. <hi>The initiatory ſeal is not primarily and properly the ſeal of mans faith, or repentance, or obedience, but of Gods Covenant rather: The ſeal is to the Covenant, even Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams Circumciſion was not primarily a ſeal to his faith of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; but to the righteouſneſſe of faith exhibited and offered in the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:168215:66"/> Covenant;</hi> yea, <hi>to the Covenant it ſelf, or promiſe, which he had belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unto righteouſneſſe: hence the Covenant of grace is called the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of faith,</hi> Rom. 10. <hi>Hence,</hi> Acts 2.38, 39. <hi>the ſeal of baptiſme is put to the promiſe, as the choyce matter and foundation in view, and as that was a ground of repentance it ſelf, Repent and be baptized, for the promiſe is to you: Not, for you have repented, as if that were the thing to be firſtly ſealed by baptiſme,</hi> but the promiſe rather.</p>
                        <p>Appendix, pag. 57. Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi> quotes in the Lump <hi>the Fathers, Councels, School-men, out of Gregory de Val.</hi> as if all were of that mind.

                        <p>Firſt, How would he like it in other things, to leave the clear rode and track of Scriptures, to hunt after humane authorities?

The Scripture-way taking in thoſe that the Word had brought to a profeſſion of Chriſtianity upon engagement to it, is as clear as though it were written with a ray of the Sun.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, For Fathers and Schoolmen, their opinion about Baptiſme, on which they ground the neceſſity of praerequiſites to it, is known; and as he may quote them againſt me, ſo I can quote them againſt him, and thoſe of his party. They maintain (and as unanimouſly as they do the thing in debate) that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments confer grace on the receiver, in caſe he put no obſtacle, on which account they expect not grace in the perſon for baptiſme, (which they believe not to be poſſible, ſeeing the Sacrament is to work it) but a convenient diſpoſition to grace, which they call <hi>merit ex congruo.</hi> Let <hi>Suarez</hi> ſpeak in the name of the reſt, having laid down this Propoſition,<note n="d" place="margin">Ut alicui digne detur baptiſmus, prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter voluntatem ſuſcipiendi Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentum ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaria eſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitio conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niens ſanctita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti Sacramenti.</note>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:168215:67"/> to attain the effect of the Sacrament,</hi> and gives his reaſon, <hi>ſeeing by baptiſme grace is given; If any one be rightly diſpoſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the effect of baptiſme, in the inſtant that he receives perfect Baptiſme, he ſhall receive grace; therefore he receives the Sacrament with ſufficient dignity and ſanctity;</hi> further adding, <hi>Seeing this is a Sacrament of the dead, grace is not praerequired for the receiving of it, being ordained to confer grace, that diſpoſition is ſufficient up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Sacrament confers ſuch an effect,</hi> Suarez in tertiam partem Thom. Tom. 3. Q. 68. Diſ. 24. art. 4. Sec. 2. p. 250. Our opinion being otherwiſe of the work of baptiſme, it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe concerning admiſſion to baptiſme, when men are willing to be received into the number of Chriſtians, and will engage for Chriſtian wayes, (which neceſſarily implies a profeſſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of all unchriſtian practices) we judge them to have right of admiſſion.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, How far rules laid down by ſome Fathers, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils for the way of diſcipline did exceed in rigour, hath been the complaint of many; not admitting thoſe that had been overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by temptation, to Church-fellowſhip: notwithſtanding any evidence of repentance, till after many years ſpace of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; In which time how much advantage might be given to Satan, let men of experience judge. Mr. <hi>F.</hi> himſelf diſlikes their long deferring of their <hi>Catechumeni</hi> from baptiſme, and may not others have liberty to manifeſt their diſlike as well as he?</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, Let it be taken into due conſideration, whether ſuch rigour in holding converts off ſo long a ſpace; and requiring ſuch an height in preparatory graces, were not a great <hi>remora</hi> to the progreſſe of the Goſpel? and gaining in men to Chriſtian profeſſion? How ſpeedy a progreſſe the Goſpel made in the Apoſtles times we may ſee in the Acts of the Apoſtles, and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Story. Dr. <hi>Andrewes</hi> in his Preface to his Work on the Commandements, quotes a teſtimony of <hi>Egeſippus,</hi> That <hi>by the diligent inſtructing of the Church, there was no known Common-Wealth of any part of the world inhabited, but within</hi> 40 <hi>years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſts Paſſion received a great ſhaking off of heatheniſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> But how ſlowly it proceeded after ſome time, is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain: May not the difference of their way, that thus ſwerved from the Apoſtles, and men in Apoſtolique times, be aſſigned as a great reaſon? We find them facile in admiſſion, but in the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:168215:67"/> mean time exceeding plain in making known what was required of them in order to the end of their profeſſed faith, their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſalvation that were admitted.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, If it may be granted, (which according to Scripture rules can never be denied) that men wrought off from Turciſme, Paganiſme, Judaiſme, and brought to a profeſſion of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and a profeſſed engagement to Chriſtian wayes, have their right, and ſtand in title to baptiſme; If then upon obſervation of inconveniences ariſing, (as jealouſies conceived that they may offer themſelves out of deſign to work themſelves into a fairer opportunity of perſecution, as was ſuſpected in <hi>Paul</hi>) the Church in Prudence, for ſome ſpace ſhall delay their admiſſion, I ſhall not contend; Onely I aſſert their right, and juſtifie their practice, that proceed accordingly, and unleſſe ſome great cauſe appear to the Churches prejudice, tendring themſelves they are actually to be received.</p>

                           <head>A Digreſsion for Vindication of Chap. <hi>32.</hi> of the <hi>Treatiſe of the Covenant,</hi> from Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Exceptions touching the Faith that entitles to Baptiſme.</head>
                           <p>HEre I am put upon it to take into conſideration,<note place="margin">The occaſion of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.</note> that which Learned Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his Apology hath been pleaſed to oppoſe againſt me. Though he be large, I ſhall make it my buſineſſe (if it may be) to be more brief. I entitled the two and thirtieth Chapter of my Treatiſe of the Covenant, in this manner, <hi>A dogmatical Faith entitles to Baptiſme:</hi> being a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollary, naturally (as I yet think) inferred from the Doctrine, that I had before delivered, of the latitude of the Covenant; explaining my ſelf, that I meant ſuch a <hi>faith, that aſſents to Goſpel-truths, though not affecting the heart, to a full choyce of Chriſt,</hi> and therefore ſhort of that Faith which is juſtifying, and ſaving; ratifying it with ſeveral arguments. In which I might well have thought, that I ſhould have found my ancient friend, my Second, rather then an Adverſary, conſidering what he had delivered, pag. 224. of his Treatiſe of Infants Church-Memberſhip. <hi>This
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:168215:68"/> opinion,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> conceſſion.</note> 
                              <hi>that the Covenant of grace which Baptiſme ſealeth, is onely to the Elect, and is not conditional, is one of the two maſter pillars in the Antinomian fabrick:</hi> and afterwards, <hi>If any ſhall think that this affirming [that Chriſt hath brought the reprobate alſo into a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace conditional] be any part of the Arminian errors, as the whole ſcope of Scriptures is againſt them, ſo Mr.</hi> Blake <hi>hath ſaid enough to ſatisfy: He that will deny reprobates to be ſo farre within the Covenant of grace, muſt not onely denye infant Baptiſme, but all Sacraments, till he be able infallibly to diſcern a man to be Elect.</hi> I did never riſe ſo high in words for my opinion as the Reader may here ſee my adverſary hath done for me, and I ſhall have more occaſion to obſerve his conceſſions in this thing. But how to reconcile all, with that which, pag 327. of the ſame Treatiſe he delivers, I know not. <hi>If men be taught once that it is a Faith ſhort of juſtifying, and ſaving faith, which admitteth men to Baptiſme, as having true right in foro Dei, it will make foul work in the Church.</hi> This he aſſerts with five ſeveral arguments, to which in the Chapter quoted I gave a brief anſwer, not once na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Author, that (if it might be) ſuch conteſts with a man that I ſo much honour, might not have been obſerved, and yet the truth not deſerted. Before he enters upon any refutation of my arguments, or vindication of his own, he is pleaſed to ſpend nine full pages, to ſhew how farre he takes unregenerate men to be in Covenant, and to diſcover (as he ſaies) my mind in this point. Neere to the cloſe of that diſcourſe, he ſaies, that <hi>what I mean by Covenanting, he deſpairs to know;</hi> which ſurely will be the Readers wonder, that knowes what he hath ſaid, pag. 224. before mentioned, <hi>I speak impartially, according to my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I think there is more true worth in thoſe two or three leaves of Mr.</hi> Blakes <hi>book in opening of the Covenant, then in all, &amp;c.</hi> And as he deſpaires to know my meaning, ſo I as much deſpair ever to make it known to him. He quotes very many expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of mine, and knowes my meaning in none of them, and ſome that I borrow from others, as Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> and <hi>Pareus,</hi> and he knowes neither my meaning nor theirs in them. And in caſe I ſhould make attempt, if it might be, to make it further clear, he hath ſtill an art, to render it obſcure. He obſerves, that I ſay, (that which I think all ſay) that <hi>the accepting of the word [preacht is the note of the Church]</hi> and gives his cenſure that <hi>that is a more laxe, and ambiguous terme, then the former.</hi> And
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:168215:68"/> ſeeing that I am not able to ſatisfie him with any notions that I can reach, I ſhall endeavour at preſent to help his ſight, in poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out to him, men in Covenant with God; that when he lookes upon the men, and the character given of God himſelf, of them, he may (if he pleaſe) gueſſe at the Covenant it ſelf.<note place="margin">Scripture-characters of men in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</note> Do's Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> know what Covenant that was, that the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of tribes, Elders, Officers, with all the men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> little ones, wives, ſtrangers, from the hewer of wood to the drawer of water entred into? <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. and what kind of men they were that avouched the Lord to be their God, and whom God avou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to be his peculiar people? <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.17, 18. Do's he know who thoſe be, that throughout the Old Teſtament-Scriptures, the Lord calls his people, his inheritance, his portion, his ſonnes and daughters? And who thoſe kinſmen of <hi>Paul</hi> according to the fleſh were, to whom pertained the <hi>Adoption,</hi> the <hi>glory,</hi> and the <hi>Covenants?</hi> Rom. 9.4. Do's he know who thoſe were in New Teſtament-times, that were converted by thouſands, myri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ads of thouſands? then he knows who God lookes upon, as his in Covenant, and to whom Covenant priviledges appertain. And doubtleſſe thoſe hearers that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> deſcribes (and from him all the Evangeliſts) <hi>of fat hearts, dimme eyes, heavy eares,</hi> whileſt God had not removed his Candleſtick, were included: They were in Covenrnt with God. If it be ſaid that theſe are ſaid to be in Covenant equivocally; I anſwer, 1. I dare not charge the conſtant language of the Spirit of God in Scripture with equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. 2. I am ſure that they upon that account, really enjoyed the priviledges under diſpute, were called by the name of a Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.38. and had that elogy, a <hi>people near unto the Lord.</hi> And to ſay that theſe were in Covenant with a <hi>quatenus, aliquo modo ſic, aliquo modo non,</hi> when God teſtifies that they avouch him to be their God, I think is too great boldneſſe. That thoſe that roſe no higher, then theſe mentioned, have no right to the great bleſſings of the Covenant, as <hi>Chriſt, pardon, Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Adoption, glory,</hi> upon that account, that they come not up to the faith called for in Covenant, I freely with Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> grant; Thoſe are too high Favours for Covenant breakers, yet I ſay, as all <hi>Iſrael</hi> did <hi>de facto</hi> enjoy, ſo all of the like faith <hi>in foro Dei</hi> have their right of his free bounty to all thoſe Church-priviledges that ſerve to fit for glory. He is pleaſed to ſay, Mr. <hi>Bl. had done better, if, with that moderate, reverend, godly man
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:168215:69"/> Mr.</hi> Stephen Marſhall <hi>he had diſtinguiſhed between thoſe two queſtions [who are Chriſtians, or Church-members?] and [whom we are to judg ſuch and uſe as ſuch?] and to bring in the latter rank onely.</hi> I know not where Mr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> thus diſtinguiſhes. If he ſpeaks of members of the Church inviſible, it is not at all to our purpoſe, we are not ſpeaking to them: And if he mean mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church viſible, I know no uſe of ſuch diſtinction, we can well enough know ſuch members, otherwiſe they were not viſible. Let Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> look upon thoſe notes of a Church-member which he mentions, where he intended a confutation of my 31. chap. in caſe I had not ſpoken to his mind, and the ſame things with him, and then ſee whether ſuch cannot be known? I think thoſe of the <hi>Worceſterſhire</hi> combination, may know who thoſe be whom they take into Communion. In a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentheſis he is pleaſed to tell me, that <hi>herein I joyn with Mr.</hi> Tombs. To which I reply, what animoſity ſoever he hath againſt me, I ſhall not leave any one truth to ſhunne agreement with him, when Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf affirms, <hi>that Mr.</hi> Tombs <hi>and he are agreed in</hi> that particular that he there mentions, pag. 92. <hi>though moſt Divines,</hi> (as he there ſaies) <hi>are againſt them both;</hi> ſure I may boldly joyn with him, when moſt Divines are for us. He tells me, <hi>Thoſe that profeſſe to fear God, and love him, we muſt love and honour as men, that do fear and love him: yet in different degrees, as the ſigns of their graces are more or leſſe probable. In ſome common confeſſing Chriſtians, we ſee but ſmall probability: yet dare we not exclude them from the Church, nor the number of true believers, as long as there is any probability; Others that are more judicious, zealous, diligent and upright of life, we have far ſtronger probability of: and therefore love and honour them much more.</hi> All this is true, in caſe we were to enquire after the fear of God in its power, or the image of God, renewed in ſincerity; But when it is applyed to viſible Church-memberſhip, I know not what to make of it. Muſt I more or leſſe honour a man, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly as he appears more or leſſe viſibly in Congregations? After a long diſcourſe about the Covenant, and faith dogmatical, which I ſhall have occaſion further to touch upon, he concludes thus, <hi>The words which Mr.</hi> Bl. <hi>queſtioneth, I confeſſe are mine, againſt Dr.</hi> Ward,<note place="margin">The Author vindicated from ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity.</note> 
                              <hi>and I did not think in ſo groſſe an opinion Dr.</hi> Ward <hi>would have found any ſecond to undertake that cauſe.</hi> How this paſſage fell from his penne, may well be to every intelligent
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:168215:69"/> Reader matter of admiration: not that he chargeth an opinion from which he diſſents, to be ſo notably groſſe, (which is not very unuſual) but that a man of ſuch multiplicity of reading, ſhould think that Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> in this opinion would not have found a ſecond, when if he hath peruſed our approved Authors about the queſtion, eſpecially ſince it came to a punctuall juſt debate, he may ſoon ſee that he hath almoſt every one to appear for him if this which he mentions be his opinion, unleſſe perhaps he hath been ſo held in reading the Fathers, and other Writers for the firſt thirteen, or fourteen hundred years (in which few will, I think, come out and vye with him,) that he hath not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded what hath been ſaid this hundred and fifty years, in this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the world, when his book came firſt out, I received a letter from as learned an hand, as any I have to converſe withall, noting this, as a ſingular tenent; and when upon occaſion I have mentioned it, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> holds that <hi>no faith that is ſhort of that which juſtifies, gives title to Baptiſme,</hi> it ſounded ſo ſtrange that I could not gain credit to the report of it. He that hath ſpent ſo much pains in that Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. cannot be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of that uſual diſtinction, of Covenant holineſſe, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe habituall, and perſonall. The former, (according to Divines and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf) is an holineſſe of relation to God, and ſeparation for him; which was found in all the Nation of the Jews, and now is in all profeſſed believers, and their ſeed. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is an inherent quality, infuſed by regeneration, by which the man is brought into conformity with the Law of God. The former (according to them, and him in that Treatiſe) gives title to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, even where the latter is wanting. Thoſe words therefore were more then needed: <hi>[If men be once taught, that it is a faith ſhort of that which is ſaving and juſtifying, which admitteth to Baptiſme]</hi> ſeeing it is in reformed Churches generally, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally taught, Mr. <hi>T.</hi> very well knowing, (as all do know) that in theſe laſt ages it is a doctrine generally received: and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf to oppoſe it, ſaith, that <hi>he can derive its pedigree no higher than</hi> Zwinglius: but he hath heard of thoſe that were <hi>Zwinglius</hi> his ſeniors, to be of the ſame mind, as the Reader may ſee in my anſwer to his letter. The Jeſuites generally charge it upon <hi>Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> and thoſe of that party; and well they may, as their opinion, but not as their invention. As to that charge, they ſtand acquitted by their adverſaries: <hi>Suarez</hi> in

Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in the words before may ſee the opinion of that Divine, whom he ſo deſervedly magnifies, Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> full againſt him; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he lives where the greateſt ſtrength of that party is, that are his oppoſites. Let the Reader obſerve his fourth concluſion, pag. 52. <hi>The Church in diſpenſing an enjoyned initiatory ſeal of the Covenant of grace, looketh unto viſibility of intereſt in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to guide her in the application thereof; nor is it the ſaving intereſt of the perſons in view, that is her rule, by which ſhe is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to proceed.</hi> And compare with it the cloſe of his whole diſcourſe upon it in theſe words: <hi>And I the more wonder, that any which confeſſe, that it's not to be denyed that God would have infants of believers in ſome ſenſe to be accounted his, to belong to his Church, and family, and not to the Devills, as true in facie Eccleſiae viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis, &amp;c. yet do oppoſe us in this particular now in queſtion.</hi> If he pleaſe to peruſe <hi>Pareus,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.14. as he ſhall find <hi>Staple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> in objections there produced, his friend, ſo <hi>Pareus</hi> fully his adverſary.

                                 <hi>is the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Covenant of Grace made onely to the Elect.</hi> Did not Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> then believe that thoſe that are non-Elect were compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in it? The concluſion of his large diſcourſe is laid down by himſelf, pag. 63. in theſe words, <hi>Though wicked men have many Promiſes from God, especially the great conditional Promiſe of life, if they will repent, and believe, and though they are alſo by their imperfect equivocal covenanting with God; yet God remaineth ſtill unoblig'd to them.</hi> But how this ſtands with that which he hath in diſpute in the place before mentioned, let him alſo take into further conſideration; where he chargeth this, as his adverſaries fourth error: <hi>That every right adminiſtration of Baptiſme, is not Gods ſealing: Actually God ſealeth not, but when it is admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to a Believer. It may be called a right act of the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, according to Gods appointment, but not Gods ſealing.</hi> Againſt which he thus diſputes, pag. 222. <hi>If the Sacrament rightly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred to an hypocrite, have all that is eſſential to Gods actual ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then it is his actual ſealing; But the Sacrament rightly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred to an hypocrite, hath all things eſſential to Gods actual ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Ergo.</hi> The <hi>Minor</hi> he proves at large, as I may have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion hereafter to make known. And whereas he ſo peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determines, that though wicked men oblige themſelves, yet God ſtill remains diſobliged, let him conſider,<note place="margin">God ſtands obliged to all that he doth avouch his people.</note> whether God be not ſome way obliged to all that he avoucheth to be his people. If this be denyed, there will be found no great happineſſe to a people, to have the Lord for their God. But God avoucheth thoſe to be his people, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.17. who are yet in an unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate eſtate. And if we look into Scriptures, we ſhall ſee that this is Gods ordinary language. Are there many worſe to be found in any viſible Church-ſtate, then thoſe with whom God holds conteſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50? Yet to theſe he ſayes, verſe 7. <hi>Hear, O my people, and I will ſpeak; O Iſrael, and I will teſtifie againſt thee: I am God, even thy God:</hi> Together with thoſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. to whom he addreſſes himſelf under theſe titles, <hi>Rulers of Sodom, people of Gomorrah:</hi> yet we ſee, verſe 2. what language he ſpeaks of them, <hi>Iſrael doth not know, my people do not underſtand.</hi> And whereas he ſtates the Queſtion as though the whole of the diſpute turned on this hinge; <hi>Whether theſe men be in Covenant with God, as to Gods
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:168215:72"/> actual engagement to them; ſo far as that Gods promiſe is in force for conveying actual right to them, as to the promiſed bleſſings? and ſo whether it be a mutual Covenant, and both parties be actually obliged? And thus I ſay that wicked men are not in Covenant with God, that is, God is not in Covenant with them: Neither have they any right to the main bleſſings given by the Covenant,</hi> viz. <hi>Chriſt, Pardon, Juſtification, Adoption, Glory.</hi> I know no man that hath ſpoke ſo much as himſelf towards the proof of it in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative: So long as they break not the Covenant-engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (in which he confeſſeth they have oblig'd themſelves,) God ſtands engaged to them for the greateſt ſpiritual bleſſings. But according to him, they break not Covenant untill they arrive at final impenitence and unbelief. He very well knowes that I hold that every wicked man in the Church lives in continuall breach of Covenant, and is therefore under the curſe and penalty of it; and that I ſhould think that God were actually engaged to give Chriſt, Pardon, Juſtification, Adoption, Glory, to them, in that ſtate and condition, were more then ſtrange. Theſe may know by vertue of their Covenant-priviledges upon what terms they may attain the mercies mentioned, and upon what terms God ſtands engaged to give them, and they enjoy the power of Ordinances to work them up to the ſaid terms, which they do not, who are without Covenant, and therefore are afar off, when men in Covenant are near. Did ever man, ſpeak of an abſolute tye in a conditional Covenant, whether the conditions are kept or no? That therefore before mentioned which he calls the great queſtion between him and me; is no queſtion at all. It were madneſſe to affirm that, which with theſe limits he thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes. Yet ſtill I ſay, that the Covenant which Baptiſme ſeales, is made with the unregenerate as well as regenerate perſons; which as we have heard, he makes Mr. <hi>Tombe's</hi> error to deny. And becauſe the Covenant belongs to them, Baptiſme in like ſort belongs to them: and as upon that account we muſt baptize them, ſo <hi>in foro Dei,</hi> according to the mind of Jeſus Chriſt, they have right to Baptiſme: Which in caſe Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſhall deny, I ſhall deſire him to reflect upon the afore-cited paſſages of his own; together with that which, pag. 65 of this Treatiſe he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. <hi>If it be the whole matter of Chriſtianity that is profeſſed, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembledly: then as he is equivocally, or analogically a believer, or Chriſtian, ſo I yield he is a member of the Church viſible.</hi> And
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:168215:72"/> Church-memberſhip is one of his own mediums to prove a right to Church-entrance by Baptiſme, and here is a Faith not above dogmatical; At leaſt, ſhort of that which is juſtifying, and yet ſuch a faith as is real, having reall fruits and effects, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times reall miracles. If the argument hold when it is thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled, how much more when it is put in its full ſtrength? Such an one is univocally in Covenant, whoſe diſſimulation is no other then neceſſarily attends an unregenerate eſtate: in caſe there be any thing in Scripture above equivocation, <hi>They remembred that God is their Rock, the high God their Redeemer,</hi> Pſal. 78.34. And whereas I ſtand charg'd in this diſcourſe by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral uncouth, if not wild, opinions and aſſertions about the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> deſpairs (as we have heard) of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of my meaning, I ſhall here endeavour, as to vindicate, ſo to explain my ſelf in like manner, that the Reader (if not Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>) may be brought to a right underſtanding; avoiding, as much as may be, both nicety, and multiplicity.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. It is ſaid, that I ſuppoſe certain Promiſes to go before the great Law of Grace. <hi>Thoſe that ſuppoſe ſuch</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are of two ſorts,</hi> 1. <hi>The Arminians and Jeſuites.</hi> 2. <hi>Such as Mr.</hi> Bl. <hi>about Church-Ordinances.</hi> And having ſpent many lines upon the Arminians to ſhew his diſſent, and aſſent, ſo that the Reader may well have forgotten both me and my charge, he ſaith, 2.<note place="margin">The Author vindicated from a fiction impoſed.</note> 
                                 <hi>The ſecond part of promiſes before the great Covenant of Grace is feigned by Mr.</hi> Bl. <hi>(and if there be any other that go that way, as ſome do, and that with ſome difference amongſt themſelves) and that is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Church-priviledges upon condition of a faith, not juſtifying, nor ſaving.</hi> One that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will not deny to be eminently learned, (and I think as well vers'd in his Writings, and mine, as any man alive; Far better, I believe, then he in mine, or I in his) upon obſervation of this paſſage, replyed as by addreſſe to him, <hi>You rather feign this of Mr.</hi> Bl. <hi>then find it in him.</hi> And I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe I know no man whoſe brain ever either hatch'd, or vented ſuch a crotchet. Neither do I know how this miſtake was ever entertained, (for I believe it was a miſtake) unleſſe it be, that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for granted that there is no Covenant of grace entred with any out of the ſtate of grace; and finding, that I aſſert, that Church-Ordinances appertain to unregenerate Chriſtians, and thoſe that are ſhort of faith that is juſtifying, he here fancies a promiſe of theſe made to a faith of this kind: Whereas that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:168215:73"/> which I ſay is, That every acceptation of a Goſpel-tender (which tenders a man a Chriſtian outwardly) actually veſts him in right to theſe Ordinances, as it did the Jew outwardly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1. And that theſe Ordinances are neceſſarily requiſite to bring men up to the fruition of thoſe happy priviledges of Pardon, Juſtification, Adoption, Glorification. So that I conceit no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of theſe Ordinances made to ſuch a faith, but an actual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture of every ſuch believer in them. Neither do I know any promiſes preceding the Covenant of Grace. Such muſt be made to meer Heathens, or thoſe that are in a parallel eſtate, <hi>aliens from the Common-wealth of Iſrael.</hi> Unleſſe perhaps ſome ſuch promiſe to ſome ſuch, upon ſome particular account may be found. Yet if he can work me to be of his mind, that <hi>Election, Regeneration,</hi> and <hi>the Covenant of Grace,</hi> are commenſurate, ſo that no non-elect man is in Covenant, then ſhall I ſay that there are Promiſes made before the Covenant. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that for the generality of them, were neither elect nor regenerate, ſaith, <hi>To them appertained the Covenants.</hi> I may therefore charge it upon him, with better reaſon then he upon me: Thoſe ſtand veſted in promiſes, that, he ſayes, are out of Covenant. <hi>The Promiſe is ſaid to belong to thoſe Jews,</hi> Rom. 9.4. <hi>on whom yet the Word took no ſaving effect,</hi> verſe 6. <hi>Hence by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the Gentiles they were thoſe that were not ſtrangers to the Church, but of it. They were not ſtrangers to the Covenant of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, but in the ſame,</hi> Eph. 2.11, 12. <hi>Hence God, ſaith he, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his Covenant with them all,</hi> Deut. 29.10, 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>ſpeaking there of that ſolemn renewal of the Covenant of Grace, as</hi> Deut. 30.6, 10, 12, 13, 14. <hi>compared with</hi> Rom. 10.6, 7, 8. <hi>evinceth.

Where much more to this purpoſe from many Texts of Scripture may be ſeen.</p>

                                 <note place="margin">The Authour further vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.</note>I am farther charged, that <hi>my common phraſe is, That they</hi> (namely unregenerate men) <hi>are in the outward Covenant,</hi> with this note upon it, <hi>what that is I cannot tell.</hi> Who would not now think but that here were a phraſe peculiarly mine: Upon which the ſame learned hand as before, expreſſeth himſelf in theſe words, <hi>I do not ſee that that phraſe is common with Mr.</hi> Bl. <hi>He rather uſeth it as from others:</hi> which any may evidently ſee, if they conſult pag. 189, 190. of my Treatiſe of the Covenant.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:168215:73"/> But of this I have ſpoke before, and therefore his gueſſes upon it, that he believes that it is called outward, by reaſon of outward bleſſings annexed to it, might have been ſpared. They that uſe it, expreſſe their own meaning, <hi>The Covenant</hi> (they ſay) <hi>is but one and the ſame; but all are not in the Covenant after one and the ſame manner: Some are onely in it by outward profeſſion, to the preſent participation of outward priviledges; but ſome by cordial acceptance</hi> to the enjoyment of ſaving benefits by means of theſe priviledges. He ſayes in the place quoted, <hi>I ſhould have thought it but reaſonable for Mr.</hi> Bl. 1. <hi>To have told us what thoſe outward bleſſings are that this Covenant promiſeth.</hi> But what need I to tell him, when, pag. 61. he hath told me, that it is a promiſe of Church-priviledges, and I now tell him that theſe ſtand actually poſſeſt of theſe priviledges, and have all the Promiſes, together with theſe priviledges that the Goſpel contains. And that theſe priviledges are appointed of God, to bring them in Gods way to the poſſeſſion of them. 2. Saith he, <hi>That he would have it proved out of Scripture that God hath ſuch a Covenant diſtinct from the Covenant of grace, which promiſeth Juſtification and Salvation, and having other conditions on our part.</hi> To this I know not what to ſay; but that when Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath proved that there are not onely mountains of earth in his Weſt ſide of <hi>England,</hi> viz. <hi>Wreakin, Mawbourn, Clee,</hi> but alſo mountnins of Gold, I will endeavour the proof of this, if I can tell how: for he hath had as many thoughts of ſuch golden <hi>Chimaera's,</hi> as I have had of any ſuch Covenant, diſtinct from the Covenant of Grace, which in my name he here imagineth. Having vindicated my ſelf from theſe impoſed fancies that never entred into my thoughts, I ſhall now endeavour, if it may be, further to clear my own meaning in theſe following Propoſitions.<note place="margin">Propoſitions tending to cleer the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note>

That all of theſe imply a Covenant-ſtate; and that unregenerate men have in Scripture all this honour, is clear. Theſe therefore with me are in Covenant. I know that as to all of theſe elogies it is anſwered in a word, that they are <hi>equivocal.</hi> An anſwer that I can ſcarce take into my thoughts without horrour; As though Gods oracles were all over, from one end of the Bible to the other, like thoſe of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and there were no reality either in their ſeparation for God, or gifts that they receive from God, (which as to illumination, conviction, faith, as well ordinary as extraordinary oftentimes are many) or priviledges that they enjoy: But this we ſhall have further oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to conſider; and when there can be no plain denial that all of this here mentioned argues Covenant-ſtate, a quarrel ſeems to be pickt, rather then any direct anſwer given. For as I ſay, pag. 189 of my Treatiſe, That in Old-Teſtament-times the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was made with <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the uttermoſt latitude of it, with all thoſe that bore the name of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> making proof at large from <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. as the Reader may ſee. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> quoting the place, takes notice of no more then that it was made with all <hi>Iſrael:</hi> and infers, pag. 65. <hi>So that it ſeems he takes all to be in Covenant that bear the name, Chriſtian.</hi> And then queſtions; <hi>What? Though they know not what Chriſt or Chriſtianity is? Is taking a name, entring into Covenant? The poor</hi> Indians <hi>that by thouſands are forced by the</hi> Spaniard <hi>to be baptized are ſaid to know ſo little what they do, that ſome of them forget the name of [a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian] which they aſſumed.</hi> And do's not he think that a man may take as plauſible exceptions againſt his word, where he ſaith, <hi>The rule is, That a ſerious profeſſour of the faith is to be taken for a true Believer;</hi> If he would travel as far as <hi>India</hi> for it, as he doth here againſt Gods Word? Do not we know, that force may make theſe poor <hi>Indians</hi> to appear ſerious in their profeſſion? And it is wonder that it ſhould be ſo ſtrange with him, that taking a name ſhould be entring Covenant, or at leaſt that it ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a Covenant-ſtate: Let him conſult, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.1. and thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold

This ought to be voluntary, as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing their old falſe way, as embracing the preſent, as we ſee it was in thoſe converts through the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles. And it is not to be without ſome competency of knowledge, diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the evill of their former courſe, and the happineſſe attaina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the preſent. And I am eaſily induced to believe that more knowledg by the induſtry of teachers, is now required, then was in the primitive times, ſeeing there is not ſo much of God by miracle to perſwade, and, as it were, to overrule: So that it is not a naked taking of a name that is intended, but that which ſtill attends upon it: As a wife is called by her husbands name, and withall makes her abode in his houſe, ſo it is with a Covenant-people, and was with <hi>Iſrael:</hi> They bore the name of God, and they made abode in the Church of God, enjoying his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances as their inheritance. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaies, <hi>For the Word of God, God oft beſtowes it on infidels, and in England there aremen that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride the truth of Scripture, and eſteem it: afliction, and yet for credit of men come ordinarily to the Congregation. Theſe have the Word given, and ſo have other unregenerate men, but not by Covenant that I know of.</hi> That God doth beſtow his Word on infidells, to me is ſtrange: it is true that he often tenders it to them, but in caſe they remain infidells, they put it away from them, and beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing implies not onely a tender, but an acceptance. It is the great advantage of <hi>Iſrael</hi> above other Nations that to them was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the oracles of God, when others had not that honour. And to ſpeak of Gods giving his Word by Covenant, is a moſt improper ſpeech, ſeeing it is the very Covenant droughts; as though we ſhould ſay, he gives his Word, by his Word. And theſe ſure are no open deriders that for the credit of men make ſuch a publique profeſſion: this would work reſtraint on the one hand, as it puts upon profeſſion on the other. And in caſe any ſuch thing be, though the Covenant is perfidiouſly broke, yet (as I
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:168215:75"/> conceive) not totally caſt off, as long as any open profeſſion is continued. What ſhall we ſay of thoſe that take their ſons, and daughters to give them to <hi>Moloch?</hi> this can be no low crime, and an high departure from the true God, yet theſe bring forth chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren unto God: and they are his children, that they thus ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.20, 21. So alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.35, &amp;c. <hi>Iſrael was mingled among the Heathen, and learned their works, and they ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their Idols, which were a ſnare to them; yea, they ſacrificed their ſons and daughters unto Devils, and ſhed innocent blood, even the blood of their ſons and daughters.</hi> Yet this, as appears, caſts them not out of Covenant; God notwithſtanding remembred with them his Covenant, ver. 45. This was therefore doubtleſſe but a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial apoſtaſie; taking in the worſhip of Idols, they did not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally caſt off the worſhip of God: God was not totally caſt off in <hi>Judah,</hi> neither did caſt off <hi>Judah. Ahaz</hi> was of the worſt of Kings, and yet his poſterity was reckoned among the people of the Lord. Had the <hi>Jews</hi> then been as ſevere diſputants againſt a Covenant-ſtate as are riſen up now, the Church of God had wanted an <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> he had never lived, much leſſe wrought ſo happy a Reformation in the Church of God.</p>

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:168215:75"/> God to be their God, and God avoucheth them to be his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And therefore when they come with their ſacrifices, though in their ſins, and God upon that account teſtifies againſt them; yet he ſayes, <hi>I am God, even thy God.</hi> It is confeſs'd by Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> that <hi>we muſt judge thoſe that make profeſſion, to be in Covenant with God: we muſt give them the name of Chriſtians, and men in Covenant with God, and we muſt uſe them as Chriſtians in works of charity and Ordinances, and Church-communion, and ſo muſt uſe their Children as Christians children.</hi> And ſeeing reaſon to judge ſo, (according to Scripture-character of men in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant) they are ſo. Either in this we judge right, or elſe we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon miſtake. If we judge aright, then all is well: If we miſtake, then all in theſe proceedings is null. Water hath been applyed to the child of ſuch an one, but no Sacrament diſpens'd; And according to a mans hopes, thoughts, or fears of his fathers regeneration, are his hopes, thoughts and fears of his own bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and conſequently of his intereſt in Church-communion; for this ſtands or falls according to his fathers intereſt or non-intereſt in the Covenant. When Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is urged with this, he uſes to refer to his Treatiſe of Infant-Baptiſme, where he layes us down a grand Rule or Maxime, and out of that extracts many others. His grand Rule is, <hi>That a ſerious Profeſſor of the faith is to be taken for a true Believer:</hi> and this being laid down, he proceeds on. If this Propoſition were a Scripture-Maxime, then it would have born a farther ſuperſtruction; but being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther found there, nor any proof made that it is any way deduced thence, mother and daughters may all juſtly be called into queſtion: and ſeeing he cannot but know, that very many as to the thing for which it is produc'd, (which is in order to admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Ordinances) will utterly deny it, he might have done well to have made ſome eſſay to have proved it. I do yield that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is to hope the beſt, but that we ſhould put our charity to it, or our reaſon either, for probability or certainty, when we are no where ſo taught, and have a more ſure rule for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, I ſee no reaſon.

But God offers to conſent onely on condition that our hearts conſent to his terms, and therefore if we profeſſe conſent, and do not conſent, God conſenteth not, nor is, as it were, obliged.</hi> This were ſomewhat to purpoſe, in caſe he could make it appear that Scripture denyes all being of a Covenant, where the all-ſeeing eye of God ſees not all integrity and ſincerity. But Scripture-language, which is the ſafeſt for us to follow, being (as we have heard) far otherwiſe, there is nothing marr'd in non-obſervance of any ſuch ſuppoſed difference: For which we ſhall preſently hear again and again Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> own confeſſion.</p>

All know that a bargain for a Summe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and the payment of that Summe: the covenant with a ſervant for labour, and the labour according to this covenant, are different things. Faithfull men that make a bargain, keep it; enter cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and ſtand to it: But the making, and keeping; the entring, and obſerving, are not the ſame: and according to this opinion, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation is our entrance into Covenant, and regeneration is our keeping of Covenant: before regeneration we make no Covenant, after regeneration we break no Covenant, there is no ſuch thing as Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-breaking.

He addes: <hi>In my Aphoriſms, (pag.</hi> 265.) <hi>I gave my reaſons for the contrary;</hi> we muſt therefore ſee firſt what is ſaid there, where he thus beſpeakes his Reader. <hi>Here let me mind you, of one uſeful obſervation more. The Covenanting on our parts, is a principal part of the conditions of the Covenant, though this may ſeem ſtrange, that a covenanting and performing conditions, ſhould be almoſt all one:</hi> And indeed, I think all intelligent Readers will judge it to be farre more ſtrange than true, though we are to hear of that which is more ſtrange preſently, we are told of reaſons in this page, but I find no piece of a reaſon in it, but onely, <hi>I ſay,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a reaſon; And I know not where any thing towards a proof of this poſition may be found, unleſſe it be in the Poets <hi>Hyperbole, Dimidium facti, qui bene coepit, habet; He that hath well begun, hath half done;</hi> yet half is not almoſt all. He goes on. <hi>It is a truth ſo farre beyond all doubt, that our own Covenanting is a principal part of the condition of the Covenant of grace, as that it is in other terms a great part of the ſubſtance of the Goſpel.</hi> Here are myſterious words. Is our covenanting a part of the condition, or is the condition a part of the Covenant? The condition is here made the <hi>integrum,</hi> and our Covenanting one part of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This is above my reaſon. And for the other part, I ſay, if our covenanting be a great part of the ſubſtance of the Goſpel, then the Jew outwardly did make a better progreſſe in Goſpel-waies then we are yet aware of, or the Apoſtle underſtood when he ſpake ſo much as we read, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. concerning him, for he was in Covenant, otherwiſe he had been no Jew at all, but a Pagan or Heathen. Having told us, (I cannot gueſſe to what end) that <hi>the ſame act is called our conditions, as the performers; and Gods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, as the impoſer, and promiſer: giving his bleſſings onely on theſe impoſed conditions,</hi> he addes, <hi>Moſt properly they are called the conditions of Gods Covenant, or promiſe, rather than of ours; for our own promiſe is the firſt part of them, and our performance of that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:168215:79"/> promiſe, but a ſecondary part:</hi> Is not here a convincing reaſon? Our own promiſe is the firſt part, our performance the ſecond part; <hi>Ergo</hi> they are more properly the conditions of Gods, Covenant then of ours. I deny not the thing, but wonder at the reaſon; but, ſpeed it as it will, I thence collect, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and performances are diſtinct things, and that is enough for me. Our promiſing to God, I am ſure, is our covenanting; this then differs from Covenant-keeping, or performance, and is not to be confounded with it. There followes, <hi>For,</hi> 2. <hi>Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is a free gift of Chriſt, and life to the World on condition of their acceptance: This our Divines againſt the Papiſts, and the doctrine of merit have fully proved.</hi> That God doth freely give Chriſt to thoſe that accept him, I freely yield, and that our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines have fully proved it againſt Papiſts, I confeſſe, and that it muſt be aſſerted againſt Antinomians; but what Divines have proved that Gods Covenant is his free gift of Chriſt, and life to the world on condition that they will accept, I know not: It is the firſt time (I think) that ever I heard it. This then is a full defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of a Covenant, which I yet think comes ſhort of it; and if it be a truth, it well ſerves my purpoſe; many a Covenant is made, and conditions never performed. After his expreſſion of himſelf about the modification of our acceptance of Chriſt by faith, he addes, <hi>Our acceptance or conſent, is our Covenanting and our Faith. So that our Covenanting with Chriſt, and our Faith is the ſame thing: that is our accepting an offered Saviour on his terms, or a conſent that he be ours, and we his on his termes. And who knowes not that this Faith or Covenanting, or conſent is the condition by us to be performed, that we may have right to Chriſt, and life offered.</hi> I do know the latter, and therefore upon that account, (as upon divers others) I deny the former. I know that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith is the condition by us to be performed; and I as well know, that it is not our covenanting, but our making good our Covenant. That Faith by which the Romans ſtood in Covenant with God, was ſuch a faith that the whole viſible Church of the Gentiles had, and the Jewes both, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. But this was not a juſtifying faith, but ſhort of it. To make juſtifying faith, and Covenanting <hi>Synonyma</hi> is an error, I am confident, of what ſize I leave to others to determine. If they were both one, Scripture would promiſcuouſly ſpeak of them; but we find that it ſtill di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth them, and gives us clearly to underſtand, that the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:168215:79"/> greateſt part of Covenanters are ſhort of Faith that is ſaving and juſtifying. Ordinances in which the Covenant of grace is diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and which ſpeak all thoſe that entertain them to be in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, are granted of God to men ſhort of juſtifying faith, as their proper inheritance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.4. Titles implying a Covenant-ſtate, (as I have abundantly ſhewed) are given of God to them that are ſhort of this faith, viz. <hi>Chriſtian, Diſciple, Saint, Believer, Called, Brethren:</hi> God impoſes Covenant-conditions, makes promiſe of Covenant-bleſſings upon theſe impoſed conditions, to thoſe that are ſhort of Faith that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth; Theſe therefore are in Covenant. Though I hear neither of Scripture nor argument, nor any thing elſe but bare words in two or three Paradoxes for my conviction, yet by a ſimilitude I ſhall underſtand, that our own Covenant-act is the primary condition of Gods Covenant. In his Aphoriſmes he ſayes, <hi>It may ſeem ſtrange,</hi> but now a ſimilitude ſhall render it familiar, <hi>If a King</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>will offer his Son in marriage to a condemned woman, and a beggar, on condition that ſhe will but have him, that is conſent, and ſo covenant and marry him; here her covenanting, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting, or marrying of him is the performance of the condition on her part, for obtaining her firſt right in him and his: but for the continuance of her right is further requiſite.</hi> If we had had either Scripture or argument to have given us a firſt light, then a <hi>Simile</hi> might have ſerved for ſomewhat, and come in as a garniſh; but being ſerved in alone, it may ſpeak the Authors thoughts, but never ſettle any in the truth. And I ſhall leave it to the Reader to judge whether the edge of it may not eaſily be turned againſt himſelf, and whether when it is brought home, it will not prove deſtructive to his own opinion. I muſt therefore tell the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that our relation to Chriſt whileſt on earth, is more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently expreſſed in Scriptures, by eſpouſals, then marriages: as we may ſee through the book of <hi>Canticles,</hi> and <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.14. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. and that there is ordinarily a relation of men to God, preceding faith that juſtifies. Now Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is not ſo ill read in the Civill Law, but that he knowes that there are <hi>ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalia de futuro,</hi> and <hi>ſponſalia de praeſenti.</hi> Thoſe, God is pleaſed to take for his people, that are his onely in the firſt relation, and to honour them with priviledges to bring them on to the ſecond. Whereas he ſayes, <hi>Our Covenant principally is to receive, nor is it onely</hi> de futuro, <hi>but</hi> de praeſenti. I may anſwer, firſt, If our
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:168215:80"/> Covenant be to receive, then it doth precede this receiving; and ſecondly, if he mean, that it is our duty to receive Chriſt in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and not to delay the leaſt moment of time, I ſhall readily yield; but in caſe he ſay, that preſent profeſſion and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to receive gives a people no title to any Covenant-relation, before Chriſt be actually and ſavingly received, I may well ask what we are to ſay to the whole body of Old Teſtament-Scriptures? were not all <hi>Iſrael</hi> in Covenant? were they not all viſibly the people of the Lord? are they not owned of God for ſuch, when they were at the worſt and loweſt? How many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Scripture-Texts may be brought to evince it? Had they called themſelves ſo, and valued themſelves as ſuch, on this account to be a people nigh unto the Lord; and no people ſo nigh, it might have been ſaid to be their own vapour; but when God gives them that teſtimony of honour, and hath never done with it, ſure he would have us to believe it. There is a firſt right therefore, before that right in the ſimilitude contended for; and that is no other but a right of Covenant: to be without God and without hope is the caſe of a meer heathen uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in the fleſh, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.11. The ſtate of viſible relation is one ſtep nearer, than aliens from the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael</hi> do enjoy; and yet too ſhort of a ſtate of ſalvation. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> concludes, <hi>By this time I leave it to the Reader to judge who it is that introduceth confuſion about the Covenant, and whether it be an error of the lower ſize:</hi> And I am very well contented to ſit down and hear his judgment: and if it be upon this determined againſt me, I ſhall ſay the authority of man is mightily prevalent. I have yet ſeen no title of Scripture, nothing of reaſon, onely that which I take to be Scripture-Paradoxes, are laid down as Maximes.<note place="margin">Reſtraint of Covenant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies any breach of Covenant.</note> There followes, <hi>As for that you adde, that then there is no Covenant-breaking, I reply,</hi> 1. <hi>quoad eſſentiam, et poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem, there is,</hi> 2. <hi>quoad exiſtentiam, there is a breaking of mere verbal and erring half Covenants; but if you think, that ſound Covenanting may be utterly broke, then you are againſt the certainty of perſeverance.</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">Real Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants may be broke.</note> I deſire to know whither this <hi>eſſence, poſſibility</hi> and <hi>exiſtence</hi> refers, whether to the Covenant, or to the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Covenant. If it refer to the Covenant, as the words ſeem plainly to imply, then here is a new piece of learning, that the eſſence of a thing may be broke, and the exiſtence ſtand firm. I have learnt that exiſtencies may be deſtroyed, and eſſences re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:168215:80"/> and inſtance is commonly given in Roſes in winter; But I have not untill now heard the contrary. But if theſe referre to breaking of Covenant, then the meaning is, there is a <hi>poſſibility,</hi> but there ſhall not be a <hi>futureity:</hi> But this is flatly to gain-ſay the Scriptures, that complain ſo frequently of actual breach of Covenant. Somewhat therefore is granted, and ſomewhat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed. It is granted that there is a breaking of mere verbal, and of erring, half-Covenants; but I am told, that if I think that ſound Covenanting may be utterly broke, then I am againſt the certainty of perſeverance. If by ſound Covenanting, truth of Covenant be meant, this may be broke, and no Saint apoſtatize, but if integrity of heart and ſuch ſoul-qualifications as might be deſired in Covenanters be underſtood, the truth of a Covenant ſtands, where this is wanting: otherwiſe none but upright, honeſt, ſincere men, can ever make bargains. It follows, <hi>They broke their particular Covenants about reforming Idolatry, and ſuch particular ſins.</hi> And theſe particular Covenants were bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of their grand Covenants, and ſo <hi>habemns reum confitentem.</hi> It is farther ſaid, <hi>They broke their verbal, and equivocal Covenant, or promiſe to God, whereby they ſeemed to accept him on his own terms, but did not.</hi> But it ſhould be remembred, that this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant they broke was a marriage-Covenant, as is frequently teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Scriptures, as, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.32. where the Lord ſpeaking of the Covenant made with <hi>Iſrael</hi> when he brought them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt: Which my Covenant they brake,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>although I was an husband unto them:</hi> which is further clear, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.1, 14, 20. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.17. This then was a reall, and no equivocal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or elſe Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> ſimilitude, on which he puts ſo much ſtreſſe, is ſpoyled. And I never knew, that verbal Covenants, where ſincerity of intention for faithful performance was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, were equivocal Covenants: much leſſe where a man did not fully underſtand himſelf in covenanting. All want of integrity is not equivocation: Men may promiſe and not perform, men may promiſe and never mean to perform, (which I think few unregenerate men directly do) and yet not equivocate. If a Gentleman ſhall promiſe a Tenant a Leaſe for life, provided that he will give him a dogge, he brings him one, and accordingly expects his Leaſe, the Landlord puts him off in telling him that he indented with him for a dog-ſtar, or a dog-fiſh, here is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation; but had he directly promiſed and broken faith, it had
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:168215:81"/> been no equivocation, but falſification. I have heard of one of quality that often ſolicited one to ſerve him, after long impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity he got a promiſe from the man, that ſuch a day he would come and ſerve him, he kept his day, and came and ſerved a writ upon him: This was equivocation; but if he had not come at all, as the ſon in the Parable did not work in the Vineyard, when he had ſaid he would, that had been plain falſification. If thoſe were equivocal Covenants, and no reality of the being of a Covenant between God and them in them, then all the honour that followed upon them, and mercies enjoyed were equivocal likewiſe. Then whenſoever God calls <hi>Iſrael his people,</hi> we muſt underſtand him his equivocal people: when he calls them <hi>his portion,</hi> we muſt underſtand it his equivocal portion: when he ſayes, <hi>Judah is his inheritance,</hi> we muſt underſtand his equivocal inheritance: and Chriſts word, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.12. <hi>The children of the Kingdom ſhall be caſt out,</hi> muſt be interpreted, the children of the equivocal Kingdom: and, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Many are</hi> equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocally <hi>called:</hi> and, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. the Apoſtle muſt be underſtood, <hi>To whom pertaineth the</hi> equivocal <hi>adoption and</hi> the equivocal <hi>glory.</hi> Theſe certainly broke Covenant, and yet we have no example of Saints apoſtaſie in them. When the Jeſuits forced Texts of Scripture to find (if it had been poſſible) one or two equivocal ſpeeches in our Saviours words, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.8. <hi>I go not yet up to this feaſt,</hi> leaving out <hi>[Yet]</hi> that ſo there might be either an untruth, (for he did go up) or an equivocation: as alſo in thoſe words of his quoted from the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.34. <hi>I have ſaid ye are gods:</hi> how would they have gloried, in caſe they had learned, that Scripture was almoſt all over equivocal? Give them this, and the day is theirs in the doctrine of equivocation.</p>
                              <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> addes, <hi>Your ſecond abſurdity is, That then there are no hypocrites,</hi> and replyes <hi>rather, Then all unregenerate profeſſors are hypocrites. They pretend meerly to real proper covenanting, and they do covenant but verbally and equivocally.</hi> But the great falſhood of this I have ſufficiently diſcovered, and therefore my Argument which he notably curtails ſtill ſtands firm. It were too tedious to trouble the Reader with all my words and his.</p>
                              <p>The third abſurdity which I preſſe, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to name, but onely refers to his anſwer to Mr. <hi>T.</hi> I ſhall therefore let it alone, not intending to interpoſe between them.</p>

                              <p>My third Argument to prove, [That a faith ſhort of juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may give title to baptiſme, is, To make the viſible ſeal of baptiſme which is the priviledge of the Church viſible to be of equall latitude with the ſeal of the Spirit which is peculiar to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible members, is a Paradox.] To which he anſwers,<note place="margin">The ſeal of the Covenant, and the ſeal of the Spirit, not of equall lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> 
                                 <hi>But you take it for granted, that we do ſo; which is too eaſie disputing:</hi> and I may well take it for granted, ſeeing in the next words he yields it; where he ſayes, <hi>We give the ſeal of Baptiſme to all, that ſeem ſound Believers, and their ſeed; and we ſay, the ſeal of the ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit is onely theirs that are ſuch believers.</hi> Their ſeeming faith works then onely by way of cheat; to procure that which is none of their right, and ſo both ſeales are of equall latitude, which yet is more plainly expreſt in his following words: <hi>But if you ſpeak onely of Covenant-right to Baptiſme,</hi> coram Deo, <hi>by his gift of Covenant, then I make them of the ſame extent;</hi> and I cannot tell what other Covenant-right to ſpeak of, but that in which God avoucheth a people to be his, and himſelf to be their God, and I dare not have a thought of any thing but reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in his words. For his diſtinction which he hints here, and plainly delivers elſewhere, <hi>of right in foro Dei, and in foro Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae, both to Covenant and Baptiſme,</hi> I ſuppoſe conſiderate men will pauſe upon it, before they receive it, eſpecially in the ſenſe which he puts upon it: 1. They may preſſe him with his own rule, <hi>
                                    <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi lex non diſtinguit, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                                    </gap>ibi non eſt diſtinguendum.</hi> Such a right to viſible Ordinances before men never granted of God, I would learn. 2. They may demand whether it be the Will of God, that any upon the latter right <hi>coram Eccleſia</hi> ſhould be baptized by the Church. If it be, then they have right <hi>coram Deo:</hi> If it be not his will, then they have no right <hi>coram Eccleſia.</hi> I know no Court that God keeps reſpective to viſible Church-priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, but his Church. 3. They may tell him of the neceſſity that is put upon Miniſters to profane this Divine Ordinance, in putting this ſeal ordinarily and unavoidably to meer blank paper, which is a moſt contumelious abuſe of it. Of <hi>many that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, few are choſen;</hi> and yet all that are viſibly called, are thus ſealed, when in Gods ſight all title is wanting. 4. They may tell him, that poor ſoules are thus miſerably cheated in bearing
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:168215:82"/> them in hand, that this great priviledge, and conſequently all further Church-priviledges are theirs, when the conveyance is more fraudulent that caſts it upon them. 5. They may yet tell him, that a door is here opened to Anabaptiſme, or multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Baptiſme. A new door, of which either nothing or very little hath ever been ſpoken. When diſcovery ſhall be made, (as according to theſe principles it may be often made) that the title, when Baptiſme was adminiſtred was barely ſeeming; then all was null <hi>ab initio</hi> in ſuch proceedings: and as ſuch perſons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes were in the eye of God, ſo now in the eye of men, they are unbaptized perſons: And in caſe God ever vouchſafe the grace of converſion to this man, he is now by Divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſeek baptiſme. In caſe <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who after bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme did diſcover himſelf to be in the gall of bitterneſſe, by Gods grace ſhould ever attain repentance and forgiveneſſe, (which <hi>Peter</hi> did not judge to be deſperate) he muſt then upon converſion afreſh offer himſelf to Baptiſme. If <hi>Titius</hi> be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into poſſeſſions preſumed to be his true inheritance, and afterwards it be made to appear that it never appertained to him, but to <hi>Sempronius;</hi> when this appears all is to be judged invalid. And if <hi>Titius</hi> ever gain due right, he muſt again procure poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and is not to hold on his former crackt and ſeeming title. So that whenſoever a Miniſter converts a baptized man, he muſt look upon former proceedings as null, and upon his converſion baptize him. Neither let Anabaptiſts here triumph, as they may baptize whom we have baptized, when they ſee them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, ſo we may baptize whom they have baptized, too many of both parties, manifeſting over-evident ſigns of their uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. 6. They may tell you that, that Scripture-diſtinction of circumciſion in the fleſh, and circumciſion in the heart, is hereby overthrown; ſeeing circumciſion in the fleſh, where cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion in the heart is wanting, is uncircumciſion: which the Apoſtle grants reſpective to true happineſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. <hi>ult.</hi> but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes reſpective to Church-priviledges, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1. 7. They may tell him, that this principle ſtanding, all perſons dying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate, dye unbaptized; yea, all that were baptized in infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and after converted, remain ſtill unbaptized. 8. That it is much to be feared, if not certainly to be concluded, that the major part by far of <hi>Worceſterſhire combination</hi> conſiſts of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized perſons, there being, I doubt, no good evidence of true
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:168215:82"/> converſion in the moſt conſiderable part of them; ſubſcription to the confeſſion there, and conſent to memberſhip, being all that is required; and whether it be enough for a good ſatisfying evidence that a man or woman is in grace, that he or ſhe hath ſubſcribed, or put to their mark, let any judge. I am ſure it is voyc'd, that the moſt prophane (where the Miniſter carries any authority) are as forward for ſubſcription as any. If all mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages were null, where grace were not in truth in the parties, I fear that through the Chriſtian world there would be more adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous, then marriage-copulations. And in caſe where there is no grace, there is no ſubject for Baptiſme, there are as many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized perſons.</p>

This is plain, no man is bound to make good his condition before engagement to conditions; no ſervant is tyed to do his work, before he hath received earneſt; no Souldier to fight, before he is liſted, or hath given in his name. But faith that is juſtifying, to accept Chriſt is the condition to which Baptiſme engageth.]</hi> To this Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> anſwers, <hi>What is the concluſion? Therefore juſtifying faith is not a prerequiſite in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, or according to the Simile no man is bound to accept Chriſt to juſtification before he is baptized:</hi> And then begins highly to Rhetoricate. <hi>I confeſſe the reading of ſuch paſſages in Grave, Learned, Godly Divines, and that with ſuch confidence uttered, as undoubted truth, and that in zeal to ſave the Church from the errors of us that are contrary minded, doth very much convince me of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailty, and that the beſt of men do know but in part, and in a little part too.</hi> If Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſeek an inſtance of humane frailty, he hath made no miſchoice in caſting his eyes upon me, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee ſo many in me as I know; but I am ſorry, that he muſt put his wit upon the device of one, or at leaſt take hold on the moſt handſome ſeeming opportunity, to cry up one, and ſo to give too much evidence (as one ſaid upon the firſt ſight of it) of his own weakneſſe. As to the concluſion, <hi>that juſtifying faith is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requiſite in Baptiſme,</hi> in the ſenſe that every Reader may ſee I have given of it, I ſhall maintain, and as Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> hath heard, I have the ſtrength of the reformed Churches for my confirmation in it; but for the other, which ſerves onely to blind the Reader, and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:168215:83"/> to bring me under a charge, <hi>that no man is bound to accent of Chriſti before he be juſtified.</hi> I look upon it as an aſſertion, both ſenſeleſſe and graceleſſe. I believe it never came into the heart of any that is either grave,<note place="margin">A poſition by the Author diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avowed and deteſted.</note> or godly to utter it, and that there is ſcarce any ſo witleſſe, or graceleſſe as to beleeve it, and ſo Mr. <hi>Brs.</hi> volume of 31.

Few of them tending to oppoſe any thing that I hold, but in the farre greateſt part brought againſt his own conceit; and no aſſertion, or opinion of mine. I ſuppoſe I could eaſily furniſh him with a large addition of reaſons, to deny this fancy; Faith is commanded in the morall Law,<note place="margin">Reaſons evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing that a man unbapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed is bound to beleeve in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to juſtification.</note> as I have aſſerted Treat. of the Covenant, pag. 18. and I think no man believes that Baptiſme doth firſt put a man under ſuch obligation. Some Papiſts do charge upon us, that we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Baptiſm delivers us from the morall Law, and therefore the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> anathematizeth thoſe that hold it, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any I think were charged to ſay, that Baptiſme is our firſt obligation to it. 2. An unbaptized man is bound to endeavour to avoid damnation, but he that believeth not ſhall be damned. 3. He is bound to endeavour to obtain Salvation; but we muſt believe with the heart, and confeſſe with the mouth to Salvation. 4. Baptiſme preſuppoſeth the Covenant; but the Covenant, as I have often ſaid, engages to believing. 5. None can be exempted from believing, but they are withall exempted from repentance; but unbaptiſed perſons are to repent, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.30. 6. Faith in Chriſt hath been actually required of the unbaptized, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.30. And therefore it is marvell that when Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> judgeth me to be overtaken in this folly, he would ſpend ſo much time with me or ſo many words upon me, tranſgreſſing the wiſe mans advice, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.4. <hi>Anſwer not a fool according to his folly.</hi> When he thought I had no more wit than to think that no man is bound to accept Chriſt for juſtification before he be baptized, I marvel that he would ſet his wit to mine. But what is it that I have ſaid to induce him to think that I am in that opinion. I have ſaid? <hi>The great condition to which Baptiſme engages, is not a prerequiſite in Baptiſme;</hi> and can any man imagine that I meant any more than that it is not required to the being of Baptiſme? Can any man think that I ever meant that it is not required of the perſon that is for Baptiſme, till after he be baptized? and have I not in the next page cleared mine own meaning, where I ſay, that <hi>there is
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:168215:83"/> no neceſſity that juſtifying faith go before, but a neceſſity that it muſt follow after Baptiſme:</hi> further explaining my ſelf, <hi>It is true that in men of years juſtifying faith ſometimes goes before Baptiſme, as in Abraham it went before Circumciſion: but it is not of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity required to intereſt us into a rite either of baptiſme or Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion;</hi> and doubtleſſe I never thought that either <hi>Abraham</hi> or any other was juſtified by that work that was never required at their hand. I ſay, juſtifying faith, or grace in the truth of it, is no prerequiſite in marriage; and I further ſay, that a Miniſter in times paſt might, and a Magiſtrate at this time may lawfully marry perſons void of juſtifying faith or grace, and yet he is no better than a graceleſſe man, that thinks that perſons unmarried are not tyed to faith and godlineſſe. Grace is no prerequiſite to buying and ſelling. A bargain of ſail ſtands firm, though there be no grace in them that make the bargain. Men without grace may go to <hi>Kidderminſter</hi> to buy hangings and curtains, and thoſe of that place may lawfully trade with them, and yet both parties are before hand bound to grace and godlineſſe. But though my aſſertion is clear enough, yet ſome may ſay, my ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude darkens it. I ſay, <hi>No ſervant is tyed to do his work, before he hath received his earneſt; no Souldier to fight, before he be liſted,</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">The Authors meaning in ſome miſtaken expreſſions cleared.</note> 
                                 <hi>or hath given in his name.</hi> To this I ſay, If my expreſſions which I thought were clear, (well knowing my own meaning, yet) to others ſeemed dark, no candid man would draw them further then the propoſition which my argument was brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, which is, That a faith dogmaticall, or as I explain it, <hi>a faith ſhort of juſtifying, entitles to Baptiſme.</hi> In my ſimilitude I looked at the reſemblance that is between a Souldiers liſting, a ſervants entertainment into his Maſters ſervice, and a Chriſtians Baptiſme. And as a Souldier is not bound in order to liſting, firſt to fight: nor a ſervant in order to his entertainment, firſt to work: ſo a Chriſtian is not bound in order to Baptiſme, firſt to believe to juſtification. And thus I fully explained my ſelf in the next page but one. <hi>That faith which is the condition of the promiſe, is not the condition in foro Dei of title to the ſeal, an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the neceſſity of ſuch faith with engagement to it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for a title to the ſeales and the performance of the condition of like neceſſity to attain the thing ſealed; To promiſe ſervice and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity in warre is enough to get liſted, as to do ſervice is of neceſſity to be rewarded.</hi> So that any Reader I think might clearly have ſeen,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:168215:84"/> and I hope now will more fully underſtand my meaning: Having taken notice of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> great miſtake, and upon it his injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous charge, I think it moſt meet in this place to take notice of another (though under another head) that ſo, at once I may vindicate my ſelf from things of this nature. I ſay, in my Treatiſe of the Covenant, chap. 16. pag. 111. <hi>Sincerity is ſaid to be the new rule, or the rule of the New Covenant.</hi> To this Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is pleaſed to reply, <hi>When I firſt read theſe words which you write in a different character, and father on me, I was aſhamed of my nonſenſe, for they are no better: but it came not into my thoughts, once to ſuſpect a forgery in your charge. Farre was I from imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that ſo reverend, pious, and dear a friend, would tell the world in print, that I ſaid that which never came into my thoughts, and confute that ſoberly and deliberately as mine that I never wrote.</hi> After many other words added, <hi>If when we are dead, men ſhould read Mr.</hi> Bl. <hi>book that never read mine, and there ſee it written that I ſaid [ſincerity is the new rule, or the rule of the New Covenant] can any man blame them to believe it, and report of me as from him, and ſay, what ſhall I not believe ſuch and ſuch a man that reports it in expreſſe words?</hi> Can any man now think but that I father this upon him;<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> not injured by the Author as he is injuriouſly charged.</note> and that I report it to the world in print, in expreſſe words, that he hath ſaid it? will it not be ſaid on Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> credit that I ſaid it, and wrong'd him in it? But I deſire the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to peruſe the whole Chapter; and in caſe he find not Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> name there at all, then he muſt needs conclude that this was ſpoken at leaſt <hi>improvidè et inconſultè,</hi> and ſome teſtimony of humane frailty given in it. I recite indeed ſome paſſages of Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> in that Chapter without his name, being unwilling indeed to make it known that he was in any ſuch opinion, or that he had laid any ſuch charge of intolerable ignorance upon learned Divines as there he does. But of this he hath heard enough already from other hands; How can he tell that I mean him in thoſe paſſages, ſeeing I never named him, but that the words are his? And when theſe words now in queſtion (produc'd at a good diſtance from the other) are none, of his, who can ſay that I meant him? much leſſe can they ſay, that I have expreſſely charged them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him. If they be in any odde corner of his book (as he ſaies he knows not but that they may be), he then may be yet char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with them, and therefore injuriouſly complains of any inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious charge upon him. But to return to what we have in hand.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:168215:84"/> Though in Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> five firſt Reaſons, there is much very well worth animadverſion, yet ſeeng there is nothing, but that which hath either already been ſpoken to, or elſe that tends to the overthrow of that ſenſeleſſe ſottiſh tenent, (which I profeſſe to abhorre) I ſhall paſſe them by. For his additionall 26. Arguments which he ſets, (I know not for what reaſon) at a great diſtance from the reſt; the greateſt part of them are brought, and mightily fortified to beat down that which I think never any but himſelfe ſet up. I think his miſconceit firſt hatch't it, and I am well content to ſtand by; and ſee him murder it; For ſo many of them as look at all in oppoſition to any thing that I hold, I ſhall take them into conſideration.</p>
                              <p>His two firſt arguments drawn from Authority,<note place="margin">Arguments bowrrowed from humane autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity examined.</note> the firſt of the Aſſembly of Divines, and others of a number of Fathers, are brought to prove that the profeſſion of a juſtifying faith is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to baptiſme; and what is that to me, who never denyed it; but in plain words have often affirmed it? It is ſufficiently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed where I require a dogmatical faith to Baptiſme. A dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical faith aſſents to that of <hi>Apollos, Jeſus is the Chriſt,</hi> and when I ſay that this entitles, I cannot mean, concealed or denyed, but openly profeſſed. If I ſay that a man hath ſix pence in his purſe may dine at ſuch an ordinary, I do not mean with ſix pance concealed, or denyed, but produced and payed. Have I not both the words [profeſſing] and [profeſſion] both in the margent and in the Index? ſeeing Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> calls upon me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare my ſelf further in this thing, I do believe, and profeſſe to hold that, he that upon hearing the Goſpell preacht and the truth of it publiſhed and opened, ſhall profeſſedly abjure all other oppoſite waies whatſoever, and chooſe the Chriſtian way for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, promiſing to follow the rules of it, is to be baptized and his ſeed, and that upon a right not onely <hi>coram Eccleſia,</hi> but <hi>coram Deo;</hi> It being the mind of God that ſuch ſhould be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The authority of reverend Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> againſt Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> is onely worthy enquiring into, citing <hi>Luther, Calvin, Bucer, Whitaker,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> obſerves. But Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands not (as he ſaies) what Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> means by the initial faith and repentance which in the judgement of the Apoſtles gave right to thoſe that deſired baptiſme, and upon that account I cannot directly tell what that is that Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> oppoſeth. The authorities quoted by him, reach not the thing that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:168215:85"/> about <hi>Luther</hi> ſaies, <hi>He</hi> (meaning <hi>Philip) will not baptize him unleſſe he beleeve;</hi> I ſay the ſame: Neither <hi>Simon Magus</hi> nor any of the Samaritans men or women could have baptiſme, before they believed. <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaies, <hi>He had not baptized him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out true faith,</hi> which is doubtleſſe to be underſtood of <hi>fides quam,</hi> not <hi>quâ credimus,</hi> as appears in his words before. <hi>There is no doubt but Ananias had firſt faithfully inſtructed Paul in the principles of godlineſſe.</hi> A beliefe of ſuch principles then <hi>Calvin</hi> meanes. <hi>Bucer</hi> ſpeakes onely <hi>of profeſſion of faith, and requiring of men to believe.</hi> Neither is there any thing in <hi>Whitakers</hi> teſtimony that comes up to our purpoſe: For Mr. <hi>Marſhalls</hi> Sermon of unity that is added, I have it not, and there is nothing quoted out of it. Whereas it is ſaid, that <hi>an hundred might eaſily, and truly be cited to this purpoſe:</hi> I ſay, if it be but to this purpoſe, it is not to our preſent purpoſe. If they be brought to prove that juſtifying faith is required of men before baptiſme, they may well prove that: but as I have ſaid, ſo I do ſay, I think ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver man denyed it. Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> I believe never oppoſed it. If they be brought to prove that no faith that is ſhort of that which is juſtifying gives title to baptiſme, and ſpeak no more than thoſe already quoted, they ſpeak not home to the purpoſe. And in caſe there be any that have ſaid, that Baptiſme ſtill preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth regeneration, and that we baptize infants or men of age onely upon this ſuppoſition as regenerate. As Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> Append. pag. 71. ſaies that, <hi>Learned Divines have given Papiſts great advantage in miſtaking the nature of juſtifying Faith, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it conſiſts in [a belief of the pardon of my own ſins;]</hi> So I may ſay, that thoſe, whoſoever they are, that have confounded Covenant-holineſſe, with that of regeneration and inherent ſanctification, have given as great advantage to others, yea, to the Papiſts themſelves. And as the former doctrine ha's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed many a weak ſoul, being not able to make good their aſſurance, they conclude thereupon their want of Faith; ſo theſe as much perplex the conſciences of thoſe that adminiſter this Ordinance, which I had rather expreſſe in Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> words then mine own, Append, pag. 70, 71. <hi>No Miniſter can groundedly adminiſter the Sacraments to any man, but to himſelf, becauſe he can be certain of no mans juſtification, being not certain of the ſincerity of their faith. And if he ſhould adventure to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter upon probabilities or charitable conjectures, then ſhould he be
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:168215:85"/> guilty of profaning the Ordinance, and every time he miſtaketh he ſhould ſet the ſeal of God to a lye:</hi> And who then durſt ever ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter a Sacrament, being never certain but that he ſhall thus abuſe it? adding further, <hi>I confeſſe ingenuouſly to you, that it was the ignorance of this one point, which chiefly cauſed me to abſtain from adminiſtring the Lords Supper for ſo many years.</hi> And I confeſſe as ingenuouſly, that in caſe he can work me to his opinion, I ſtand reſolved for preſent to baptize no Infant, as being unable to know the Parents faith to juſtification; and further with <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laes</hi> concluding that <hi>the Parents faith doth not juſtifie the child;</hi> but as <hi>Calvin</hi> reſolves, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>inſtit.</hi> cap. 16. Sect. 20. <hi>they are baptized into future faith and repentance,</hi> which <hi>Walaeus</hi> alſo ſayes is the opinion of moſt others: Neither ſhall I baptize any man of years till I have as high aſſurance, if not more, of his juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, than Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſeems to think any man can have of his own. If this muſt ſtand, then Paedobaptiſts and Anabaptiſts muſt all leave their Principles; and both men and women when they have learn'd to read that new name in the white ſtone, [that is] have concluded their aſſurance, muſt turn Sebaptiſts, and then let us look for as many counterfeits, as there were Jews in Chriſts time with broad Phylacteries. Thoſe that bottom Baptiſme on the Covenant, holineſſe of Covenant, diſtinct from that of ſanctification, ſtand enſnared in none of theſe difficulties or inextricable perplexities.</p>
                              <p>All the following Arguments to the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. may be eaſily gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that is thus formed,<note place="margin">Titles given by Apoſtles do not argue that in their thoughts they were alwaies anſwered with inherent grace.</note> 
                                 <hi>If the Apoſtles uſe to communicate the proper titles of the juſtified to all that are baptized, (till they ſee them prove apoſtates or hypocrites) then they did take all the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to be probably juſtified, (though they might know that there were hypocrites among them, yet either they knew them not, or might not denominate the body from a few that they did know) But the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent is true; Therefore.</hi> For the truth of the antecedent here laid down, [That the Apoſtles uſe to communicate the proper titles of the juſtified to all that are baptized,] I expect better proof then a naked affirmation. And all that is brought for proof, is, <hi>I need not cite Scripture to prove, that the baptized ar called by the Apoſtles Believers, Saints, Diſciples, Chriſtians; Mr.</hi> Bl. <hi>hath done it already,</hi> pag. 28. And he very well knowes that I there make it good, That thoſe titles are not proper to the juſtified, but ordinarily given to thoſe that are not juſtified,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:168215:86"/> nor in any ſaving condition. But if my words in the place quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or elſewhere may not be heard, Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> ſure will take, who in his Saints reſt, Part 4. Sect. 3. p. 105. ſaith, <hi>There are many Saints (or ſanctifyed men) that yet ſhall never come to heaven, who are onely Saints by their ſeparation from Paganiſme into fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the viſible Church, but not Saints in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, by ſeparation from the ungodly into the fellowſhip of the myſticall body of Chriſt,</hi> quoting theſe following Scriptures, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.6. and 14.2, 21. and 26.19. and 28.9. <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.13, 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1. <hi>compared with</hi> verſ. 12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17. and 14.33. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. <hi>compared with</hi> 11.20, 21. <hi>&amp;c. Gal.</hi> 3.26. <hi>compared with Gal.</hi> 3.3, 4. and 4.11 and 5.2, 3, 4. <hi>John</hi> 15.2. His demand therefore to me is ſtrange: <hi>Now who knows not that ſalvation is made the portion of Believers, Saints, Diſciples?</hi> when he himſelf affirms that there are Saints that never ſhall be ſaved. He afterwards puts a further queſtion, <hi>Is it another ſort of them?</hi> or <hi>doth the Scripture uſe to divide Saints as a genus into two ſpecies? Not that I know of: It is but an aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocum in ſua aequivocata. The name belongs to them but as the name of a Man to a Corps, &amp;c.</hi> Then it ſeems that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Reality in ſuch Separations. <hi>Camero</hi> tells us otherwiſe, that <hi>there is a reality in this Saintſhip by ſeparation.</hi> In the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his diſpute with <hi>Courcellius</hi> he affirmed, that <hi>the Text of the Apoſtle,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.14. <hi>was without doubt to be underſtood of reall holineſſe.</hi> To which <hi>Courcellius</hi> replying, <hi>He that is really holy hath no need of regeneration and baptiſme: But Infants of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers after they are borne have need of baptiſme and regeneration; Ergo.</hi> Which <hi>Camero</hi> anſwered, (as the relation ſayes) by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing of real holineſſe, which is twofold: <hi>One conſiſting in the bare relation of the perſon to the people of God, or the Church, and depends wholly upon birth within the pale of the Church, and of parents embracing the Covenant. The other is,</hi> &amp;c. And it ſeems that the Scripture is ſtill under the change of equivocal ſpeeches all over. As <hi>Camero</hi> hath ſomewhere obſerved, that <hi>the word Saints in Scripture is far more frequently taken for Saints on Earth, then for Saints in heaven;</hi> ſo I doubt not but it may be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that it ſpeaks far more frequently of Saints by dedication, and ſeparation, and ſo of Believers and Diſciples by profeſſion, then by inherent qualification; and doth it in all theſe places ſpeak equivocally? had it been affirmed to be <hi>Genus Analogum,</hi>
                                 <pb n="151" facs="tcp:168215:86"/> in oppoſition to <hi>uni vocum,</hi>

I would know for my learning, what advantage or profit a dead Corps is in Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to enjoy; I think one at all: but theſe (as the Apoſtle tells us) have much every way, even they that have no more then ſanctity of this nature; If ſuch equivocation be found in the word [Saint] their the like is to be affirmed of the word Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, and believers having their denomination from their faith, that is equivocal in like manner, and ſo our Common diviſion of faith into dogmatical or hiſtorical, temporary, miraculous, and juſtifying, is but a diviſion of an <hi>aequivocum in ſua aequivocata,</hi> which I ſhould think no man would affirm, much leſſe Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> who makes <hi>common and ſpecial graces to differ onely gradually,</hi> and then as cold in a remiſſe degree may grow to that which is intenſe, ſo one <hi>aequivocatum</hi> may riſe to the nature of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>animal terreſtre</hi> may become <hi>Sidus coeleſte;</hi> one of our dogs that we uſe on Earth, may become a ſtar in heaven; then mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous faith it ſelf hath onely the name, and nothing of the power and nature of faith in it. <hi>Judas</hi> had power given him to caſt out unclean ſpirits, <hi>Maetth.</hi> 10.1, 4. and he never had faith that juſtifieth; if his faith was onely aequivocal, then the unclean Spirits were equivocall likewiſe; I ſhall never believe that an aequivocal faith can caſt out a real devil. The Apoſtle tells us of faith to the remooval of Mountains void of charity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2. If this were equivocall <hi>faith,</hi> thoſe muſt be equivocal <hi>Mountains.</hi> Mr. Baxter addes, <hi>To put the matter beyond doubt, I wiſh Mr.</hi> Bl. <hi>to conſider that it's not onely theſe forementioned titles, but even the reſt which he will acknowledge proper to the regenerate, which are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Apoſtles generally to the baptized. Inſtances given in Adoption,</hi> Gal. 3.26, 27. <hi>union with Chriſt and ſeveral others.</hi> If I will acknowledge this, I ſhall be ſoon brought to yield up all. Is all Adoption proper to the regenerate? what ſhall we ſay then to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. <hi>To them pertained the Adoption?</hi> Had the Apoſtle that heavineſſe and continual ſorrow of heart, for Iſrael after the fleſh, and doth he yet give them that teſtimony that they are regenerate? <hi>Gomarus</hi> on the place hath theſe words, <hi>Leſt any in this place ſhould miſtake Adoption and acceptation for ſons in Scripture is twofold, general
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:168215:87"/> and ſpecial. General adoption is an outward deſtination or call into the viſible Church and Company of the Sons of God, upon which account many are ſaid to be the Sonnes of God, as oppoſite to the Sonnes of men, that is, aliens from the Church, Gen.</hi> 6.2. <hi>And Iſrael this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral way are called the ſons of God, not onely thoſe that were elect to life eternall and regenerate, but alſo thoſe that were reprobate and meerly carnal, and therefore the Jewes, Sons of the kingdome, or the Church of God, are ſaid to be caſt into utter darkneſſe,</hi> Matth. 8.12. And whether all union with Chriſt imply regeneration, let <hi>John</hi> 15.2. be conſulted, where an union with Chriſt is cleerly held out; yet Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> brings that text among others to prove that there are ſome Saints that ſhall never be ſaved. Mr. <hi>Hudſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> tell us at large that, <hi>Chriſt is the head of the Church viſible, and hath many unfruitful members.</hi> Other phraſes are there brought, or titles as proper to the regenerate; which are well known in Scripture to be applyed to ſuch as have Apoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and are brought by <hi>Arminians</hi> to prove falling away, and are anſwered by their adverſaries; Mr. <hi>Hudſons</hi> words are here worthy of conſideration. <hi>Onely the inviſible company have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal spiritual communion, and are elect, many of thoſe that have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal communion and are viſible members ſhall periſh, and yet by reaſon of their profeſſion, are ſaid,</hi> 2.

                              <p>I find little or nothing in all the other Arguments but that which either looks not at all towards any thing that I hold,<note place="margin">Humane au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</note> or elſe is already ſpoken to.

                                 <hi>This fiction of two Militant Churches which is put upon them, is a manifeſt Calumny, they do not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Church Militant into two Species, but they diſtinguiſh and hold forth a double respect or conſideration of one and the ſame Church: One according to the inward Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and the other according to the outward manner of Existence.</hi> Yet this muſt be taken further into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, ſeeing from this diſtribution of the Church, Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> hath got up an Argument to prove viſible Churches to be no Churches, which is his nineteenth Argument of his 26. and is thus framed: <hi>If the diſtribution of the Church into viſible and inviſible be but of the ſubject into divers adjuncts, and not of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus into its Species, then that part or thoſe Members, which are meerly viſible, are indeed no part of the Members of the Church ſo diſtributed, but are onely Equivocally called a Church, Church-Members, &amp;c.</hi> The Antecedent muſt be yielded him; <hi>the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>is undeniable, in that adjuncts are no part of the Eſſence, much leſſe the form, or the whole Eſſence; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot denominate, but aequivocally, inſtead of the eſſence.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>To this I anſwer, the conſequence might as fairly have been, that theſe members which are inviſible, are no parts or members of the Church ſo diſtributed, ſeeing inviſibility, or inviſible (as is confeſt) is an adjunct as well as viſibility or viſible. There may be a diſtribution of man by hundreds of adjuncts, either corpulent or leane, high or low, black or fair, old or young, rich or poor,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:168215:89"/> learned or unlearned, &amp;c. If one of theſe ſo denominated be a true man, ſhall the other then be onely aequivocally a man? If a corpulent man be a true man, is a leane man no man? If a tall, black or old man be a true man, ſhall then a low, fair or young man be no man? This muſt needs follow as well as the other. The reaſon given, <hi>that adjuncts are no part of the Eſſence,</hi> is not at all to the purpoſe, ſeeing the ſubject that is denominated by ſuch adjuncts, hath its Eſſence; though blackneſſe be not of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a man, yet the man that is black hath his eſſence; and though viſibility be not of the eſſence of the Church, yet the Church which is denominated viſible hath its eſſence. And whereas we are warned to note, that <hi>viſibile is not the ſame with viſum;</hi> ſo I can give warning that <hi>inviſibile,</hi> is not the ſame with <hi>non viſum,</hi> though I know not to what purpoſe.</p>
                              <p>Secondly, I anſwer, the Church being an <hi>integrum,</hi> and that <hi>per aggregationem,</hi> and onely one, in exact propriety of ſpeech, it cannot be capable of any ſuch diſtribution: ſo there muſt be one Church of one denomination, and another of another, but it is a diſtribution of Church-members, which ſerve as parts to make up the whole: ſome of which are onely viſible, that is all their honour, to make a viſible profeſſion, and to enjoy the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Ordinances, and the Divine protection of God over his vineyard; upon which account they are nigh, when others are a far off. The other are inviſible members; As they have all the viſible honour before mentioned, ſo they have an addition of a far greater glory of inviſible graces. The former I take to be the Church moſt properly (though I know others are of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other opinion) for two reaſons. 1. When the Church is an <hi>integrum</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Hudſon</hi> hath largely proved it) the viſible Church containes the whole, for the inviſible part is alſo viſible, inviſible reſpective to graces, but viſible reſpective to profeſſion and outward priviledges: The inviſible is onely one part, and ſo not the Church in its moſt proper ſignification. 2. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture almoſt whereſoever it ſpeakes of a Church, takes it in this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and that which is the ordinary and common language of the holy Ghoſt, which he uſes moſt often, almoſt alwayes, is that which is moſt proper. Some have ſaid, that the word Church is not more then once taken for the Church inviſible, which is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23. <hi>The Church of the firſt born.</hi> If it ſhould be granted, that there is two or three places more, which will bear
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:168215:90"/> that acceptation of it, which is as much as can be pretended; yet I dare ſay, there is not one for twenty, where the Church is taken for the Church viſible: And is the language of Scripture ſtill all over aequivocal? When Chriſt ſayes, <hi>The Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is like to a man that ſowed good ſeed in his field; is like to a draw-net:</hi> ſhall we ſay, the Kingdome of heaven aequivocally taken? <hi>Stephen</hi> ſayes, <hi>This was he that was in the Church in the wilderneſſe;</hi> muſt we underſtand it of the Church aequivocal? And when <hi>Paul</hi> gave <hi>Timothy</hi> a directory, how to behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>in the houſe of God,</hi> which he ſayes, <hi>is the Church of the living God;</hi> muſt we underſtand it of a Church aequivocal? Such a one would be but a weak ground or pillar of the truth; we may ſay the ſame of abundant other places. If all theſe aequivocals be granted, it will ſhortly be queſtioned, whether there be any reality in Scripture language.</p>

But let us here take up that which he is pleaſed to yield, and compare it with that which he hath put into the Index of his Treatiſe of Infant-Baptiſme, where he notes this as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his Error; <hi>That the Covenant whereof Baptiſme is the ſeal, is onely the abſolute Covenant made onely to the Elect, which pag.</hi> 223. <hi>he confutes.</hi> And if men in the ſtate of nature be in that Covenant that Baptiſme ſeales, <hi>(viz)</hi> the conditional Covenant, then men in the ſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſhort of juſtifying faith, have right to Baptiſme. It follows, <hi>In my opinion the tranſition is very eaſie from Mr.</hi> Blakes <hi>opinion to Arminianiſme, if not unavoidable ſave by retreat, or by not ſeeing the connexion of the conſequence to the antecedent.</hi> When this was charged upon me by another hand, I was acquitted by Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> and he teſtified for me, that I had acquitted Mr. <hi>M.</hi> from any ſuch charge. I marvel therefore that now it ſhould
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:168215:90"/> be faſtened upon me. But let us hear his reaſon, <hi>For grant once that common faith doth</hi> coram Deo <hi>give right to Baptiſme, and it is very eaſie to prove, that it gives right to the end of Baptiſme, God having not inſtituted it to be an empty ſign to thoſe that have true right to it.</hi> What is it that we hear, will it give immediate right to the end of Baptiſme? That may be eaſily ſaid, but I think hardly proved. It is no empty ſign, if in the right uſe of it, it may prove ſerviceable to it; I am ſure the Jew outwardly had right to the Oracles of God, and yet no immediate certain right to their end, which is to be the power of God to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, It will be an hard task, to prove the certainty of all their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that in the right of God ſtand entitled to any Ordinance of his: the reaſon will hold of all as well as one, they are not empty and vain. The Jewes had right to Circumciſion in the fleſh, and none that was a Jew outwardly might neglect it, and yet were void of Circumciſion of the heart, or forgiveneſs of ſin. The concluſion is, <hi>That it will be no hard matter to prove, that it is ſome ſpecial grace that is the end of Baptiſme, at leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin. And ſo upon the right uſe of common grace, God ſhould be in Covenant obliged to give them ſpecial grace, which is taken for Pelagianiſme.</hi> It will far rather follow from that opinion, that a common and ſpecial grace differ onely gradually, not ſpecifically; According to that promiſe of our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.12. <hi>To him that hath ſhall be given,</hi> which our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines have ſtill underſtood of graces of the ſame, and not of a different kind: he that hath common graces and improves them, ſhall have a larger meaſure of thoſe graces; and he that hath ſpiritual graces and improves them, ſhall have a more large mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſpiritual gifts. And if they be both of one kind, then Chriſts promiſe holds from the one to the other. It will be an hard matter I think to prove, that all that have right in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, though they make no right uſe, ſhall attain to the end of them.</p>

                                 <pb n="160" facs="tcp:168215:91"/> He is certainly much to ſeek both in Syllogiſmes and Common reaſon that could not infer, and could not know that I left the Reader to infer, that, <hi>Ergo</hi> a faith that is ſhort of juſtifying, entitles to Baptiſme. And ſo I have the whole in queſtion yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that which was once ſaid would make foul work in the Church if once granted. But as ſoon as it is yielded me, a Means is unkindly uſed to take it away from me. And it is further an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>That may be ſaid to admit to Baptiſme which ſo qualifieth the perſon as that we are bound to baptize him, as being one that ſeemeth ſound in believing as Simon did.</hi> If ſuch liberty of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation be yielded, who may not eaſily elude the ſenſe of any Scripture-Text? the Text ſaith, that <hi>Simon believed, and was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized:</hi> Is it now enough for us to ſay he ſeemed to believe, and therefore thoſe whom he thus deceived were bound to baptize him? Let the whole Text be viewed, and the former Verſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in, and then let us ſee whether ſuch a Gloſſe be fair. <hi>When they believed Philip, preaching the things concerning the Kingdome of God, and the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, they were baptized both men and women. Then Simon himſelf believed alſo.</hi> That faith upon which all the other <hi>Samaritans</hi> were admitted to Baptiſme, <hi>Simon</hi> was admitted upon alſo: But it was not a ſeeming to believe, but a believing that admitted the other <hi>Samaritans;</hi> Therefore it was believing, not a ſeeming to believe that admitted <hi>Simon.</hi> When the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>Simon believed,</hi> as he ſaith other Samaritans believed, and his faith ſatisfied <hi>Philip,</hi> full of the Holy Ghoſt, to give him admittance; How may we that ſtand at this diſtance dare to call it into queſtion? If the Seal were put to a meer blank paper, why is not all reverſed upon diſcovery of a Miſpriſion in proceeding? So any man would do that had put a Seal where no name was written. Why was not all <hi>ipſo facto</hi> made null? what reaſon could be given but that <hi>Peter,</hi> had he been of that mind, ſhould have ſaid, Repent of this thy wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe, that upon teſtimony given of thine integrity thou mayeſt yet be baptized? But when the Text ſayes he did believe, and <hi>Philip</hi> upon that account thus proceeded, and no retractation upon ſuch diſcovery was made, I believe no ſuch Gloſſe is to be ſuffered. My ſixth and laſt Argument was, <hi>[In caſe onely juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith give admiſſion to Baptiſme, then none is able to baptize, ſeeing this by none is diſcerned.]</hi> To which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſayes very little, but onely refers to what he hath ſaid to Mr. <hi>Tombs;</hi> and

This argument me thinks might be of force with Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi> when he had urged it for proof, that infants are ſervants, and ought to be baptized, he adds, pag. 18. <hi>Is not here then direction enough to help us to judge of the mind of God, whether infants are his Diſciples,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:168215:92"/> and ſervants or no? Doth not God call them his ſervants himſelf? What more ſhould a man expect to warrant him to do ſo?

                                 <hi>baptizing them, he meant ſincere diſciples, though we cannot know them to be ſincere.</hi> I have anſwered, that this diſcipleſhip which Chriſt here mentions is ſuch, of which whole Nations are in a Capacity, which was made plain by the Commiſſion, concluding. If whole Nations, yea, the whole uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal viſible Church (conſiſting of diſcipled Nations) were all believers, it were a great happineſſe, Chriſt on the contrary ſaith, <hi>Many are called, but few choſen.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> replyes, <hi>If it be not ſincere diſciples that Chriſt means in that Text, Then no Apoſtle was bound by that Commiſſion and great Precept, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:168215:94"/> the making of ſincere Diſciples; but onely counterfeits, and half Chriſtians: But the Antecedent is falſe: Therefore.</hi> I am ſorry to hear the Conſtitution of viſible Churches to ſuffer this brand of making counterfeit, and half Chriſtians. It is well known whoſe Language it is, That all charging or urging of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon unregenerate perſons, is onely to bring them to hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie. Do not all know that the means neceſſarily conducible muſt be uſed in order to the end propoſed? In order to make men ſincere diſciples, they muſt be made viſible profeſſing diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. They may be half Chriſtians (if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will have it ſo) in order to whole Chriſtians. <hi>Dr. Ames</hi> (if I do not miſremember) <hi>compares viſible Churches to rough ſtones taken out of the quarry, and inviſible Chriſtians to ſtones hewed and poliſhed;</hi> I am ſure they muſt be taken out of the quarry to be put into the building. It is ſaid, that <hi>Melanchton</hi> uſed to wiſh, that there were more hypocrites in the world, then there were; not that he would have more diſſembling among thoſe that made profeſſion of Chriſtianity, but more brought in to make profeſſion. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion being a good ſtep in the way to ſincerity, which a man would think Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would not diſlike, who ſo far ſpeaks the mind of Chriſt towards men, that <hi>if they will come but onely to a viſible profeſſion, he will not deny them admittance there, becauſe they intend to go no further, but will let them come as neer as they will.</hi> And what he ſayes of Chriſts readineſſe for admittance, I may ſay of Miniſters endeavours, they muſt bring them thus far, in order to a greater work. Miniſters are to be inſtrumental by the work of regeneration to make men babes in Chriſt, and by remiſſe heat reſembling ſmoaking flax, to bring them up to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fervour; Shall we thence infer, that they are to make men luke-warm, which is a temper that Chriſt will not bear? We therefore diſtinguiſh of luke-warmneſſe: 1. As a <hi>medium</hi> to further heat, ſo Miniſters muſt bring men up to it. 2. As a <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus,</hi> or end in which men reſt: So conſidered, a Miniſters work is to bring men beyond it; the ſame we may ſay of a viſible profeſſion, as a <hi>medium,</hi> not as a <hi>terminus,</hi> it muſt be all Miniſters endeavours. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> cannot be ignorant that Mr. <hi>Marſhall,</hi> and others that are for Infant-Baptiſme, have proved, (and Mr. <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:168215:95"/> their hands; entring, as Chriſt tells them, into other mens labours, what that Nation was, they muſt by their endeavors work all to be. That was a Nation of profeſſed, diſciples, and hither they are by their Commiſſion to bring all Nations. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> addes, <hi>For your Argument, I grant the Concluſion, and what would ye have more?</hi> I wiſh no more, ſo that you will ſtand to your word, and then viſible diſciples, of which whole Nations conſiſt, according to Chriſts Commiſſion, have right to Baptiſme, and I think that is the thing in Queſtion. He yet ſaith, <hi>I grant the Minor, taking the word diſciples equivocally, as a Corps is called a man, and I confeſſe it uſual ſo to take the word, but otherwiſe I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Minor.</hi> But I abhor that acceptation. Honeſt-meaning men do not uſe to ſay ſo, much leſſe the Holy Ghoſt, as though I ſhould ſay, that I had kept twenty men in my houſe theſe twenty years, and then come off with a tale of twenty pictures. I aſſert a reality in that diſcipleſhip which you call aequivocal: As for that which followes, <hi>To be Chriſts Diſciple (as to the Aged) is to be one that hath unfeignedly taken Chriſt for his Maſter to teach him and rule him, renouncing the contrary guidance of the fleſh, the devill, and the world, &amp;c.</hi> This is true as to the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of heaven, but not as to Inheritance of Ordinances; in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the further work of ſincerity, that qualifies for heaven. The Jew outwardly was not thus qualified, and yet he had upon that account juſt title to Church-priviledges, and in particular to Circumciſion. There followes to your Confirmation, <hi>I deny the Minor, and I ſay that it is ſo new a doctrine to affirm, that whole Nations are not capable of being ſound believers, that it deſerved one word of proof: Much leſſe ſhould you have hid your Minor, and turned it into a Negatio Exiſtentiae, when it ſhould have been but a Negatio Capacitatis: Doth it follow that a Nation is not capable of ſound faith, becauſe they have it not? or will not have it?</hi> and afterwards you ſay, <hi>If there be any Nation uncapable of faith, then God cannot make them believers.</hi> And ſo in concluſion you will have ſtones to be in this capacity, for God can make them diſciples, as well as he can of <hi>them raiſe up Children to Abraham.</hi> But you might eaſily know that I intended a Capacity to be brought into this ſtate in Gods ordinary regular way by the Apoſtles Miniſtry. And, Chap. 27. pag. 194. I had before thus explained my ſelf, <hi>That which a whole Nation in Gods ordinary way of adminiſtration is in a Capacity to attain, and enter into, is
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:168215:95"/> onely a Covenant profeſſed, viſibly entred upon, and doth not require any inward change or work upon the ſoul to the being of it.</hi> This is plain, it cannot be expected in Gods ordinary way, that a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be brought forth at once, all inwardly holy and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, ſuch a field without tares hath not been ſeen, ſuch a floor without chaffe, ſuch a draw-Net without any fiſh that's bad; ſuch a feaſt and none without a wedding Garment. So that this is a doctrine ſo clear, that proof needs not, where there never ſhall be any futuriety we may well and fairly ſpeak of an inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity. Capacity is vain when it is known and confeſt, Exiſtence ſhall never follow: But there muſt never be any ſuch exiſtence, as appears in Chriſts and the Apoſtles Parables of mixtures in viſible Churches, and hitherto all ages have had experience. Whereas you ſay, <hi>Do you think Preachers yet be not bound to indeavour the ſaving converſion of whole Nations? If you ſay, No; you take them off the work their Maſter hath ſet them on. If you ſay, Yea: Then you think they must indeavour to perſwade men to that which they have not a Capacity of.</hi> I think they are to bring them if heathens to a viſible profeſſion, and as many as may be to thorow converſion. That is ſomewhat remarkable which followes, <hi>Vocation uneffectual is common to Pagans. Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion throughly Effectual is of the ſame extent with juſtification, and I think Election.</hi> A Pagan called according to Scripture, is a Contradiction <hi>in adjecto.</hi> Calling in Scripture-phraſe is not a bare tender, but accompanied with a profeſſed anſwer. That ſpeech of Chriſt, <hi>Many are called, but few choſen,</hi> is the cloſe of two Parables, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.16. &amp; 22.14. the one of Labourers called into the vineyard, the other of Gueſts called to the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. And in both applyed to them that anſwered to the Call, that came and laboured in the vineyard, that came with other bidden ones to the Feaſt, and not to thoſe that refuſed. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this doctrine there is no Medium between a Pagan and a juſtified man, all Pagans and unjuſtified men are upon the ſame terms, the Jew outwardly (whatſoever St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the contrary) hath no profit or advantage above the heathen. When the Pſalmiſt gives that Elogy to the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a people near unto the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148.14. the ſame may be ſaid of every Pagan that is an alien from the Common-Wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> if once he hath manifeſted ſo much ſtubbornneſſe as to refuſe a Goſpel-tender. Scripture makes viſible Church-Members nigh,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:168215:96"/> when others are afar off, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.13. and in viſible Churches ſome according to Scriptures are more nigh then others, <hi>Mark</hi> 12.34. when yet both are in an unjuſtified Condition.</p>

                                 <note place="margin">Mar. 16.16. vindicated.</note>Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> ſecond Argument to prove, that onely juſtifying Faith gives title to Baptiſme is thus laid down, <hi>When he ſaith, He that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved, here Faith goes before Baptiſme, and that not a common, but a ſaving faith; for here is but one faith ſpoken of, and that is before Baptiſme.</hi> I have anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that this is the weakeſt of all Arguments, to reaſon for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency of one before another from the order in which they are placed in Scripture, and gave divers Inſtances not needful to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat. Upon which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> confeſſeth, <hi>there may be an Hyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron Proteron:</hi> and then if Hyſterons and Proterons be any a thing to our preſent purpoſe, it reſts upon him to prove that here is none. 2. I know not how this figure of Rhetorick came to be talked on, I think no ſuch thing is here to be aſſerted. So I ſhould ſay Baptiſme doth alwaies lead, and Faith follow. I onely ſaid that all that can be collected hence, is, that in Gods ordinary way of conferring ſalvation we muſt have both Faith and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, though (as our Divines have generally obſerved againſt the Papiſts) there is not one and the ſame kind of neceſſity, which they confirm by the words that follow. If Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will contend for an exact order, then he muſt ſay that Faith alwaies precedes, and never followes after Baptiſme, againſt the common obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that ſometimes it precedes, ſometimes it accompanies, ſometimes it followes, and he muſt alſo ſay that without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of a Divine order no baptized man can be converted to a Faith that is juſtifying; And then he may preach in <hi>England</hi> to build up Converts, but not to convert: or at leaſt when he hath converted, he muſt baptize his convert; the ſeal is null that goes before a Covenant. I gave inſtance in that place of Peter, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. where the reſtipulation or anſwer of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence followes upon Baptiſme, affirming that juſtifying Faith is that reſtipulation, or at leaſt a principall branch of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no neceſſity that it ſhould precede; but a neceſſity that it ſhould follow; In which I did not imply that a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Baptiſme may not believe, as I gave inſtance in <hi>Abraham</hi> to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:168215:96"/> the contrary, but that it tyeth him to the faith, at leaſt to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith, <hi>I gratefully accept your Conceſſion, that juſtifying faith is that reſtipulation, which is your Minor, (that is, juſtifying faith profeſſed) and thence I conclude, that juſtifying faith is eſſential to the Mutual Covenant, and ſo without it God is not in Covenant with men. It is very well worth our enquiry how this can follow which is thus made good. Who knowes not that ever read Civil Law, that there is no ſtipulation ſine promiſſione, which you call, and ſo do other Divines, Reſtipulation. And that this Reſtipulation is an eſſentiall part of the Contract called ſtipulation, This being paſt doubt, it followes, that juſtifying faith being our Reſtipulation, is an Eſſential part of the Contract or Baptiſmall Covenant.</hi> They onely (it ſeems) that have read the Civil Law, can ſee a neceſſity of this Concluſion. I, and other Divines, call this promiſe Reſtipulation; and I (though other Divines do not) ſay that juſtifying faith is this Reſtipulation or promiſe. And ſo the Promiſe being eſſential, Faith is eſſential to our being in Covenant likewiſe. But can Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> think that it is the Promiſe or Reſtipulation ſtrictly ſo called, or that I ſo intended it? then this is a true Propoſition, juſtifying faith is a Promiſe; can any think that I ever intended ſo egregious a peece of affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nonſenſe? Juſtifying faith with me is the thing promiſed, or that to which we reſtipulate. Who that hath read Rhetorick, or heard any man ſpeak, doth not know that the promiſe is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily put for the thing promiſed? and then the Concluſion will follow the clean contrary way. If you could prove out of the Civil Law or elſewhere, that there is no <hi>Pollicitatio ſine Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatione,</hi> that every man that enters Covenant <hi>eo nomine</hi> makes good his Covenant. Then you hit the nayl on the head, and till that is done, you have done nothing.</p>

                              <p>Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> third Argument is, <hi>That faith to which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of remiſſion, and juſtification is made, muſt alſo be ſealed to (or that faith which is the Condition of the promiſe is the condition, in foro dei, of the title to the ſeal): But it is onely ſolid true faith which is the condition of the promiſe (of remiſſion):</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">In what ſenſe faith is the condition of the Promiſe.</note> 
                                 <hi>Therefore it is that which gives right, in foro Dei, to the ſeal.</hi> To this I have anſwered, faith is not ſealed to, but remiſſion of ſins, or Salvation upon
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:168215:97"/> condition of faith; and when I come to ſpeak of the ſealing of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, I ſhall God willing make this more evident, that the Sacrament <hi>qua</hi> ſeal immediately reſpects our priviledges, and not duties, and I referre the Reader thither. When I ſay a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of faith may ingage to a lively working faith, I am follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this Dilemma. <hi>You mean either a profeſſor of that lively faith or a profeſſor of a dead, not working faith. If the firſt, it is a contradiction to ſay he profeſſeth to have a lively faith, and he onely ingageth ſo to believe hereafter. For if he profeſſe to have it alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, then he can ingage onely to the continuation, and not to the incepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. If you mean the latter, then I ſhall ſhew you anon, that a man profeſſing a dead, not working faith, is not in Scripture called to Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God in Baptiſme, to believe lively for the future, (incep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivè) and to believe for the future with a working faith.</hi> I ſhall firſt ſecond this dilemma with another of like nature, and then anſwer. He that thus profeſſeth to have a lively faith, either profeſſeth it knowingly, ſo that he is aſſured that he ſpeaks the truth, or with haeſitations, doubts and fears, ſo that he queſtions the truth of all that himſelf ſaies. The latter doubtleſſe can give no title according to Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi> For a man to profeſſe, and remain whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uncertain of the truth of ſuch profeſſion, can give no ſuch ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle as is required; if the former be intended, that every man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing muſt know the truth of his profeſſion, then none that are below aſſurance that in preſent they ſavingly believe, have any right to Baptiſme, and then you ſee how high we are gone. Some think it is too much to require a full aſſurance of Grace from all that enter or are allowed to poſſeſſe their places in the Miniſtery, much more of all that enter into Chriſtianity. For a direct an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, I therefore ſay, It is not profeſſion to ſay that we have this faith, but a profeſſion of our aſſent to the neceſſity of it, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to it that gives this title. There followes, <hi>You ſuppoſe then, ſuch a profeſſor as this coming to Baptiſme, ſaying, Lord, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that thou art God alone, and Chriſt the onely Redeemer, and the Holy Ghoſt the guide and ſanctifier of thy people, and that the world, fleſh and devil is to be renounced for thee: but at preſent there are luſts ſo deare to me, that I will not forſake them for thee. I will not take thee for my God, to rule me, or be my happineſſe; nor will I take Chriſt to governe me, and ſave me in his way; nor will I be guided, or ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt; but hereafter I will, and therefore I come to be baptized.</hi> If I ſay ſuch have
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:168215:97"/> right to baptiſme, and you ſay we are bound to baptize them, how do you mend the matter? do not you conclude your fourty ſixt Section with theſe words? <hi>Vocation which is effectual onely to bring men to an outward profeſſion of ſaving faith, is larger then election, and makes men ſuch whom we are bound to baptize.</hi> 2. I ſay and do profeſſe of thoſe that have thoſe ſecret reſervations wrapt up in their breſts, and not yet from under the power of luſts, yet convinced of their duty, and acknowledging the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, that it is the mind of God that they ſhould be baptized, and have admiſſion to ordinances, in order to bring them more ſincerely and unreſervedly to God. And this being the will of God, as you ſeem to yeeld when you ſay <hi>we are bound to baptize them;</hi> I ſay they have right in the ſight of God to Baptiſme, and it were ill with the Church if thoſe in Auſtins caſe, that would pray, <hi>Da caſtitatem, da temperantiam Domine, ſed non modò,</hi> ſhould be denyed all inveſtiture in Church priviledges. Where Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaies, <hi>that faith which is the condition of the promiſe is the condition in foro Dei of title to the ſeal:</hi> And I ſay, that I judge the contrary to be undenyable; After many words which are needleſſe to repeat, we have his reaſons, with a complaint that I have given no reaſon of my denyal. To which I ſay, That which in a parentheſis without reaſon is affirmed, may without rendring any reaſon be denyed. But before I come to conſider of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, it is neceſſary that the terms be looked into, and the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on rightly ſtated, that there may be no miſunderſtanding. When Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> ſpeaks of the condition of the promiſe, I ſuppoſe he means the condition called for, in order to the attainment of the thing promiſed, the promiſe for the object of the promiſe, as it is taken, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. Otherwiſe the promiſe it ſelf properly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hath no condition. There was no condition inducing God to make promiſe of Chriſt, nor to make tender of any ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. But he promiſes glory by Chriſt on his own terms and propoſitions. Now for the reaſons themſelves to make good that; that which is the condition of the promiſe, is the condition of title to the ſeal. The firſt is, <hi>The ſeal is but an affix to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: therefore that which is the condition of the promiſe, is, the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſeal.</hi> The ſeal is no affix to the thing promiſed, but it is often ſeparated from it. It is a means to convey, and a way to confirm it upon Gods tearms to thoſe that have their Intereſt in the Covenant. 2. <hi>The uſe of the ſeal is to confirm the promiſe to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:168215:98"/> him to whom it is ſealed: Therefore the condition of the promiſe is the condition of the ſeal.</hi> When it is granted that the uſe of the ſeal is to confirm the thing promiſed, it will not therefore follow that there is the ſame condition required for intereſt in the ſeal as for intereſt in the thing in promiſe. If a man will ingage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſeal to give me one hundred pounds, provided that I will come to ſuch a place and accept it, my profeſſed willingneſſe will Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt me in the ſeal, my actual acceptance in the Moneys. 3. <hi>If the promiſe and ſeal have two diſtinct conditions, then there are two diſtinct Covenants, (for from the conditions moſt commonly are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts specified; and therefore Weſenbechius and ſuch like Logical Civilians, call it the form of the contract, or ſtipulation, to be either pura, vel in diem, vel ſub conditiene, and thoſe ſubconditions are ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified oft from their various conditions) But there is not two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants: Therefore.</hi> I know not well how to reach this. Is there not one thing needful to intereſt me in a bargain, or to make me a Covenanter, and another thing to obtain the benefit accruing by ſuch conditional bargain or Covenant? 4. <hi>Is it not againſt the nature and common uſe of ſealing that it ſhould be in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the promiſe or Covenant? And that men ſhould firſt have right to that ſeal on one condition before they have right to the promiſe, and then have right to the promiſe after on another condition.</hi> But ſure it is not againſt the nature of ſeals to be before the mercy cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted for, and promiſed. And I beſeech you take this into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſideration, and do not ſleightly paſſe it. Juſtifying faith with you is the Covenant, and do not you preach to work men up to it? and I hope your labours are happily ſucceſſeful. Yet all of theſe to whom you preach (perhaps not a man except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) hath this ſeal, and is baptized. Do you now in all your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial labours go againſt the nature and common uſe of ſealing? To keep a due order we muſt then forbear baptizing, not onely till men profeſſe to believe, but are actually in the faith, in a way that juſtifies. 5. <hi>If it be ſo undenyable that that faith which is the condition of the promiſe, is not the condition in foro Dei of title to the ſeal, as you affirm, why then do ye build ſo much againſt Mr.</hi> Tombs, <hi>on that Argument from</hi> Acts 2. <hi>The promiſe is to you and your Children, arguing a right to the ſeal from an intereſt in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe?</hi> I Argue not from an intereſt in the ſeal to an intereſt in the thing promiſed, but require ſomething further. By this it appears that you take the promiſe properly, and not for the thing
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:168215:98"/> promiſed, and then I pray you reconcile this to your ſecond reaſon; The uſe of a ſeal is not to confirm in this that I have a promiſe, but that I ſhall have intereſt in the good that is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. 6. <hi>Where you ſay that an acknowledgement of the neceſſity of ſuch faith with ingagement to it is ſufficient for a title to the ſeal; I reply then thoſe that at preſent renounce Chriſt ſo it be againſt their knowledge, and conſcience, and will ingage to own him ſincerely for the future, have a title to Baptiſme.</hi> How comes I pray you that [future] in? you manifeſt much reading in the Law, and I have heard this as a Maxime, <hi>In obligationibus ubi nullus certus ſtatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itur dies, quovis die debetur,</hi> There is no day overtaken but the ingagement is for preſent; though God in mercy except when for a long time the ingagement hath been preſumptuouſly neglected. But bring me a man that in his heart is convinced that Jeſus is the Chriſt, with his mouth profeſſes him, and ingages for him, and in the mean ſpace actually renounceth him, and I will do what you would have me with him; That is, a man that is falling headlong down a ladder, at the ſame inſtant he is climbing up it. When I bring this ſimilitude for illuſtration of the point in hand, that a promiſed ſervice and fidelity in war is enough to get liſted, and to do ſervice is of neceſſity to be rewarded, I am told <hi>that this runs upon the great miſtake which I have been ſo often told of, and am further informed that the formal reaſon and denomination of a condition is from the donors conſtitution, or impoſition, giving this benefit onely on the terms by him aſſigned, and not upon our promiſe to perform them.</hi> If I have been told of it often, it is well if I can be convinced of it now. I utterly deny that the denomination of conditions of a Covenant in actual being, is from the one, and not from the other, that is, excluſively to the other. I well know the donour is to preſcribe, and the receiver is to accept without putting in Exceptions. But if there be no acceptance of terms, there is no Covenant; and there being no Covenant, there can be no Covenant conditions, as is plain by the uſual definition of Covenants; where the Goſpel is preached, and no entertainment at all given, there is no Covenant people of God, they ſtand bound by Law precepts, but are under no obligations to Covenant conditions.</p>

                              <p>The next Argument in which I am concerned, and the laſt which in this thing is produced, is, <hi>That the Eunuch muſt firſt believe, and then be baptized; upon his deſire of Baptiſme,</hi> Philip <hi>ſaith, If thou believeſt with all thy heart, thou maieſt.</hi> This I have confeſt carries more colour then all the former; and indeed I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver met with any thing, either in Scripture, or reaſon produced, that carries with me ſo much as any colour for it, this excepted. Yet this is not unanſwerable. One difficult text does not uſe to take us off our hold of many plain ones. I anſwer, 1. <hi>Philip</hi> may call for that <hi>de bene eſſe,</hi> when the Eunuch was to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which was not yet eſſential to his admittance. Thoſe that preach preparatory Sermons for the Lords Supper, call for allthat may give the higheſt comforts, and not barely for that which is the <hi>Minimum quod ſic,</hi> to give admiſſion. 2. As I have ſaid, ſo I ſay ſtill, that dogmatical faith is a true faith, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent needleſſe Criticiſms, it is truly a divine faith, ſo that none can ſay that Jeſus is the Chriſt (can believingly ſubſcribe that Article) but by the holy Ghoſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3. And whoſoever ſayes with aſſent of judgment and underſtanding, that Jeſus the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> is Chriſt, the Son of the living God, ſpeaks more then fleſh and blood can ſuggeſt, and is not attainable but by Divine revelation. And whereas it is objected, <hi>that it is a falſe faith, when it pretends to be that which Scripture calls faith in Chriſt, and denominateth believors;</hi> I anſwer, 1. I have ſhewed before, that our proſeſſion qualifying for Baptiſme, is not a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion that we have ſuch faith, (which cannot be done without an eminence of faith to aſſurance) but a profeſſion of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of it to ſalvation, and an engagement to it. 2. It denominates believers in the ordinary and common language of Scriptures, and whereſoever believer is put in oppoſition to unbeliever or infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, faith of this nature is ſtill underſtood. In that famous text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. every man and woman is a believer, that was removed from heatheniſh Idolatry to the profeſſion of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, or (as <hi>Paulinus,</hi> whom <hi>Jerom</hi> ſo much magnifies, ſpeaks) was <hi>a baptized perſon.</hi> Otherwiſe the caſe there put about the validity of marriage, and lawfulneſs of marriage ſociety were not between an infidel and a profeſſour of Chriſtianity, but between
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:168215:99"/> a regenerate man whom this language onely makes a believer, and one unregenerate, which in this language are infidels, which were a caſe never yet put to queſtion. When mention is made through the Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts</hi> of ſo many thouſands that upon the Apoſtles preaching believed, it can denote no more then the embracing of the way of Chriſtianity, in oppoſition to Judaiſme or Heatheniſme. If it imply a through Regeneration of the ſoul, there could be no unregenerate ones among them, which is wholly againſt the nature of viſible Churches, and all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, as hath been abundantly manifeſted. As for that diſtinction (which ſeems to be hinted) between believing Chriſt, and believing in Chriſt, Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> in his Treatiſe of Faith, pag. 5. hath ſufficiently ſhewed the groundleſneſſe of it, pointing out Scriptures where a prepoſition is added to the word believe, when nothing but aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of mind is ſignified; And where it is put without a prepoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when truſt and confidence is implyed. <hi>Abraham believed God,</hi> Rom. 4.3. (where no prepoſition is added) <hi>and it was counted to him for righteouſneſſe.</hi> And on the contrary the Rulers belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <gap reason="foreign">
                                    <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                                 </gap>, <hi>in</hi> or <hi>on Chriſt, and loved the praiſe of men more then the praiſe of God,</hi> Joh. 12.42, 43. It followes, <hi>I think if a man ſay, This is the Son, the Heir, Come let us kill him, and the inheritance ſhall be ours, we will not have this man reign over us, that theſe are not true believers, nor have right to Baptiſme, though their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief that he was the heir be a dogmaticall faith true in its kind.</hi> I am ſorry that ſuch things ſhould be mentioned, where inquiry after truth is <hi>contended,</hi> and contention not ſtudied. It is well known, that I ſpeak to a faith of profeſſion, which is theirs that take to that party which is for Chriſt, and not with thoſe that profeſſedly go in a full oppoſition againſt him, and are in a high rode (any ſuch conviction of ſpirit ſuppoſed) of ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. I know not why Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> ſhould be brought in, telling us, that <hi>in thoſe places where ſaving faith is ſpoke to, truſt in the Meſſiah is ever included:</hi> ſeeing we are ſpeaking of a faith that is ſhort of ſaving, nor yet that I ſhould be told that words of knowledge and aſſent do in Scripture oft imply affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and conſent, unleſſe that it be to let me know that it doth not generally hold; which in caſe I were in a ſtrait, and at want for a preſent anſwer, would well help me out. And whereas I am demanded, whether I do not know how ordinarily ſaving faith it ſelf is denominated from the Intellectual act alone? I anſwer, that I do know it, and if I were ignorant of it before, Mr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſe</hi>
                                 <pb n="178" facs="tcp:168215:100"/> hath taught me the ſame thing, with the ſame reaſon of it in his Spiritual Refining, page 170, 171. Poſ. 8. And I know alſo, that it hath its denomination often from the act of the will alone; But will it follow that the underſtanding is never fully perſwaded for aſſent, but the will is alſo (not alone ſomewhat moved, but) throughly inclined for conſent and acceptance. If the underſtanding at any time be brought to a reall aſſent whileſt the will is ſwayed by luſts and takes to other objects, that is to me ſufficient. Or will it follow that either the <hi>Eunuch</hi> did or muſt neceſſarily be preſumed to underſtand, upon that little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance that it ſeems he yet had in the Goſpel, the whole of thoſe choyce obſervations? or can it be any way certainly col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, that ſuch a Confeſſion that he made was accompanied with a preſent ſaving work? But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath ſingularly engaged me to him, quoting thoſe Texts, <hi>John</hi> 11.25, 26, 27. <hi>John</hi> 1.49, 50. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.15. he addes, <hi>Here is more then right to Baptiſme.</hi> Then a man may have right to Baptiſme that is ſhort of thoſe great priviledges of dwelling in God, and being born of God; and I ſcarce know what to ſay more for my own opinion. It further followes, <hi>If you think (as you ſeem by your anſwer to do) that a man may aſſent to the truth of the Gospel with all his heart, and yet be void of juſtifying faith, you do not lightly erre.</hi> It followes not (I think) from any thing that I have ſaid, that I am in any ſuch opinion. That Expreſſion is in <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips</hi> words, and I have told you he might require <hi>de bene eſſe,</hi> that which is not neceſſary to the <hi>eſſe</hi> of Baptiſme. But in caſe I be in any ſo heavy an Error, I am thus holpen out of it. <hi>Though an unregenerate man may believe as many truths as the regenerate, yet not with all his heart;</hi> Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. <hi>The Word hath not rooting in him.</hi> It is then granted, that he may believe all truths, and that which is added to prove that he cannot believe them with his whole heart, is not with me convincing. <hi>The Word had not root:</hi> not becauſe they did not intirely from the heart aſſent to it; But becauſe they received it not in the love of it. They received the light to inform their judgments, not any thorow heat for the warmth of their affections. There followes, <hi>Doubtleſſe whether or no the practical underſtanding do unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly determine the will, yet God doth not ſanctifie the underſtanding truly, and leave the will unſanctified: which muſt be ſaid, if the dogmatical faith that is the Intellectual aſſent of a wicked man, be
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:168215:100"/> as ſtrong as that of a true believer.</hi> Here is ſuggeſted that I ſay, that the Intellectual aſſent of a wicked man is as ſtrong as that of a true believer. I know not where I have ſaid it, or any thing that implies it. It may be a true aſſent, though not of that ſtrength. But if I had ſaid it will it thence follow, that God doth ſanctifie the underſtanding truly, and leave the will unſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified? I trow not. Is every ſtrong Intellectual aſſent ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? is every Intellectual aſſent which is of equal ſtrength with that in the regenerate truly ſanctified? Clearneſſe of light commands aſſent to truths, when corruption of affections will not ſuffer that at leaſt <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> that the goodneſſe or beſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe (if I may ſo ſay) ſhould be believed. I believe it is as ſtrong in the Devils as in any Regenerate man in the world. I know not how it fares with ſome whom God may exerciſe more gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſpective to temptations and Satans Buffettings, I am ſure that there are thoſe that would ſometimes freely give up all that is dear to them in the world, to be as clear in ſome fundamental truths as Satan himſelf; he doubtleſſe injects Scruples where himſelf is without ſcruple. I know ſome queſtion whether there be any ſuch thing as faith in divels, notwithſtanding <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Devils believe and tremble.</hi> But certain it is, there is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual aſſent to Divine truth in the Devils, as we may ſee, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.29. <hi>Mark</hi> 3.11. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.41. <hi>Acts</hi> 19.15. and yet there is no ſanctification wrought. And therefore though the wicked match the regenerate in aſſent in their underſtanding, it will not follow that their underſtandings therefore are truly ſanctified. I am further referr'd to Dr. <hi>Downam</hi> againſt Mr. <hi>Pemble,</hi> which is not in my hands, and whether my anſwer be equal to ſilence, as is in the cloſe affirmed, I muſt leave to the Reader to determine.</p>

                           <head>Advertiſements given to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> touching his undertaking for Mr. <hi>Firmin.</hi>
                           </head>
                           <p>IN a diſtinct Section Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> lets us know, how good a mind he had to have appeared in this cauſe for Mr. <hi>Firmin,</hi> which wonderful change in him, may well be my admiration: All know that have looked into my Birth-priviledge, that I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the ſame things there, as, in my Treatiſe of the Covenant, I have aſſerted againſt Mr. <hi>Firmin;</hi> and that paſt with Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> (if reports have not deceived me) with good approbation. I communicated to him a conſiderable part of my defence of it, againſt Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his letter in Manuſcripts, and I bluſh not to tell the Reader that he applauded it. And beſides what I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced already out of him, I have a witneſſe of reverend eſteem; that he hath ſaid that I had given him in diſcourſe full ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of the title of unregenerate men (or ſome phraſe par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

But in caſe upon change of judgment, he will appear for Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi> in this particular, and <hi>that meerly</hi> (as he ſayes) <hi>in love of the truth, leaſt the reputation of man ſhould cloud it; and in love to the Church, and the luſtre of the Chriſtian name, leſt this fearful gap ſhould let in that pollution that may make Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity ſeem no better then the other Religions of the world.</hi> Further explaining himſelf, <hi>For I fear, this looſe doctrine</hi> (ſo he is pleaſed to call it) <hi>of Baptiſme will do more to the pollution of the Church, then others looſe doctrine of the Lords Supper, or as much.</hi> If upon theſe ſpecious pretences he hath ſtill a mind to it, I ſhall crave leave to offer ſome words by way of advice to him.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, To reconcile himſelf to Mr. <hi>F.</hi> they being as yet ſo far from agreement, either in judgment or in practice; both of them are gone out of the road of the Reformed Churches, but Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> friend (for whom he is about to undertake) as to his judgment is yet in the lower form, when he is in the upper. Mr. <hi>F.</hi> requires not truth of grace to make a viſible Church-member, but declares himſelf very largely againſt it; he requires not truth of grace in a parent to entitle his child in the right of Baptiſme. It is enough with him that he be a man of knowledge, and free from ſcandal, which he well knowes to be the caſe of many in unregeneration. And though Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is thus gone
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:168215:101"/> beyond him in judgment, yet he ſits down far ſhort of him in practice, and ſayes that we are bound to baptize all thoſe that make an outward profeſſion, and conſequently their children; when Mr. <hi>F.</hi> upon tender, conſcienciouſly refuſes many of them. Mr. <hi>F.</hi> and I are, as I ſuppoſe, upon neerer terms of accord, then Mr. <hi>F.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> both of us agreeing that unregenerate men have their title, and a faith that is ſhort of juſtifying may give intereſt.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, To reconcile Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi> to himſelf, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> much honours him (as alſo many others) for his book againſt the ſeparation, and he tells reverend Mr. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> (who hath wrote againſt him in this ſubject) that poſſibly he may make uſe of his book about the ſeparation againſt him; and Mr. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> hath in readineſſe (as I am informed from his own mouth) not a few contradictions to charge upon him, and this I can tell both Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>F.</hi> that the beſt friends that I ever met with of them both, confeſſe, that he is a far other man in theſe writings then when he wrote againſt the ſeparation.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, To help him out of the principles of Anabaptiſme into which he is alſo obſerved by his friends to be fallen, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the intereſt of the ſeed in Covenant-title, to be peculiar to the Jewiſh Nation.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, to take further care to ſhut the door againſt a new flood of Anabaptiſme, which (as I have ſhewed) himſelf hath ſet wide open; If unregenerate perſons be void of all right to Baptiſme, then their Baptiſme is null, and upon regeneration are to be baptized.</p>
                           <p>Fifthly, To conſider with himſelf how he will anſwer the breach he makes in the Church of Chriſt, having the whole face and practice (as <hi>Apollonius</hi> ſpeaks) of reformed Churches againſt him. That Black ink which he caſts, not onely on me, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Mr. <hi>Cawdrey,</hi> (who have appeared in this cauſe againſt Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi>) but on the face of ſo many Churches ſo glorious, is unworthy of his pen; what man of name in all the reformed Churches that is not guilty of this fearful pollution as he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to call it? <hi>Ameſius</hi> is a man not to be ſuſpected here of partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, (in ſome things departing from the way of diſcipline of thoſe Churches where he lived,) yet he tells the world, <hi>That it is falſe that they require inward vertues to make a man a viſible Church-member:</hi> in which he is Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> adverſary: and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:168215:102"/> what liberty he allowes (which Mr. <hi>F.</hi> denyes) for the Baptiſme of the Infants of wicked Parents, of Infants of illegitimate birth, of Infants of excommunicate perſons, let him be conſulted, Caſes of Conſcience, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Cap.</hi> 27. <hi>Wallaeus</hi> excluding from Baptiſme the Infants of ſuch Parents that profeſſe they will bring them up in impiety, hereſie, and idolatry, <hi>But out of this caſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we judge that Baptiſme belongs to all thoſe Infants which are born of a Chriſtian race,</hi>

Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi> doth ſufficiently declare how ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible he is of his diſſent from his brethren, let Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> then undertaking for him, ſee how wide a breach he is like to make inſtead of union. If that complement therefore which is caſt upon me by Mr. <hi>Baxter, Si pace tanti viri dixerim,</hi> had been <hi>tantorum virorum,</hi> and had ſpoken out who thoſe be that he ſo heavily charges as before, to obſcure the Church, and the luſtre of the Chriſtian name, &amp;c. and plainly told us that it is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of all that go under the name of Churches reformed, the ſpeech does not now appear ſo modeſt, but then it would have been as arrogant.</p>
                           <p>Sixthly, That he make ſome proviſion for tender and ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous conſciences that ſhall admit his principles, 1. In taking in of members into Church-fellowſhip, as it is called. A man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grace in a viſible Church according to him is as a wooden leg in the body; how great a deformity this is, and how great a trouble to have ſuch inſtead of thoſe that are of fleſh and bone, it is eaſy to judge, and yet how many of theſe neceſſarily will and muſt be received? 2. In baptiſme of Infants. To baptize an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant is with him, not onely to eſpouſe, but to ſolemnize a full and actual marriage with Chriſt Jeſus, and that in words not <hi>de futuro,</hi> but <hi>de praeſenti,</hi> and what further glory then they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from his hand I ſcarce can tell. An illuſtrious Prince will
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:168215:103"/> have none but of noble and Royal blood, and Chriſt will have none to be thus, in marriage relation given to him but the ſeed of regenerate, and graciouſly qualified perſons. How ſhall I get intelligence that this or that infant is deſcended of ſuch a race? where ſhall I learn his or her pedigree, that I may thus give to Chriſt Ieſus? And in caſe probabilities muſt lead us, we have need of further help then yet we ſee, to judge of ſuch probability. Muſt we find thoſe qualifications in the man, who himſelf is for Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme or his child, that may move us to conclude that in all reaſon and poſſible apparance here is a child of God, or an Infant of a regenerate perſon? Or will it ſerve our turn, and ſatisfie our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, that we cannot certainly conclude the contrary? If the firſt be required, it will put all the Miniſters of Chriſt hard to it, and prove ſuch a ſnare that I know not how they will extricate themſelves; If the latter be that which we muſt receive, here is then a looſe rule for to lead in ſo high proceedings. For men will be ſo laxe in their own marriage choice, as for to take any into that ſociety, if they be not able to conclude her a ſtrumpet or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately wicked; we have hitherto believed that Jeſus Chriſt is pleaſed to receive in a greater latitude into viſible relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                           <p>Seventhly, I deſire Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to tell us how he hath mended the matter, and provided for the honour and luſtre of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an name, or made up at all that gappe of which he ſpeaks. He ſaies the Church is bound to baptize as largely, as I ſay men have right to Baptiſme. I think here he will find little or no difference; and when he refuſes none that I receive, and where I ſay they have right, he ſaies, we are bound to baptize without right; how will this make Chriſtianity to look with any better face? how much will <hi>Worceſterſhire</hi> Congregations, where this is received, exceed other Congregations, where unanimouſly it is denyed? I would have him to reflect on his 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Argument, and ſee whether the force of it be not evidently as much againſt hinſelf as it is againſt me, againſt whom it is brought. It is thus framed; That doctrine which makes it the regular way in Baptiſme, for all men to promiſe that which they can neither ſincerely promiſe nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, is unſound. But ſuch is Mr. <hi>Blakes:</hi> Ergo. And after much work to explain himſelf, it comes to this, that unregenerate men cannot reſolve or ſincerely promiſe to love, believe or obey, and therefore upon that account are without right to baptiſme. Let it
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:168215:103"/> be taken into conſideration, that when I ſay theſe men that in their preſent ſtate are thus unable to love, believe, and obey, have notwithſtanding right to Baptiſme, and he ſaies that this inability notwithſtanding, they ought to be baptized, how is the matter mended? If my Doctrine upon this account be unſound, his doctrine and practice will be found unſound likwiſe. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Vocation which is effectual onely to bring men to an outward profeſſion of faith, is larger then election, and makes men ſuch whom we are bound to baptize.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Eighthly, I ſhall deſire ſome Scripture text or cogent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to make it appear that we are bound to baptize thoſe that in the ſight of God have no right to Baptiſme, the command given will argue with me their right, unleſſe I hear an injunction from heaven that notwithſtanding their want of right we are to baptize them. <hi>Peter</hi> argues the right of thoſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.47. for their admiſſion to Baptiſme, which had been more then needed, in caſe without any ſuch right the water in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme might have been applied unto them; and I marvel that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſhould ſo tenaciouſly hold to <hi>Philips</hi> ſpeech to the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> If thou believeſt with all thy heart, thou mayeſt; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he believes as well as I that faith ſhort of this which he ſaies theſe words neceſſarily imply, might have admitted him, and put a neceſſity on <hi>Philip</hi> to have baptized him, though it would not have given him right to Baptiſme. His actual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and not his right, is there put to the queſtion. If theſe things be well conſidered, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> may ſee cauſe to begin with a confutation of Mr. <hi>F.</hi> before he undertakes a defence; and I ſuppoſe the Reader will ſee that he had ſmall cauſe to cenſure my Arguments to be ſo dilute unleſſe he himſelf had brought ſome of greater ſtrength.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, I would have Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſeriouſly conſider, whether that which we have obſerved already out of him, and might yet further be gathered, may not make up a forcible Argument, and concluſive of this title to Baptiſme, in thoſe who yet riſe not up to the Faith that is juſtifying, when they are ſeparate from Paganiſme into fellowſhip with the viſible Church, as he aſſerts, <hi>Saints Reſt,</hi> Part 4. Sect. 3. pag. 105. and with them their iſſue, as he hath concluded from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. when they attain to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces real, and true, as we have ſeen from him; I am ſure the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, as hath been ſaid, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.47. argues from ſuch qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:168215:104"/> to an intereſt in Baptiſme; when they have their intereſt in the Covenant of grace, as a fruit of Chriſts death, as he ſaith, doubtleſſe reprobates have, Treatiſe of Infant-Baptiſme, pag. 224. when their Baptiſme hath all that is eſſential to Gods ſealing, as he aſſerts it hath pag. 222. All of this laid together, with more that may be taken up, will in all indifferent Readers eyes conclude a title: And further, whether he have not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as much in plain words, <hi>terminis terminantibus</hi> for the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of unregenerate men, or men of a meer viſible profeſſion in Baptiſme, let his words be conſidered, Saints Reſt, Part 4. Sect. 3. pag. 104, 105. Where giving holy, and ſeaſonable advice to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware the company of ſenſual, and ungodly men, he limits it with Cautions, leaſt it ſhould be thought, that he perſwades, as he rightly ſtiles it, unto an ungodly ſeparation, he addes, <hi>As I never found one word in Scripture, where either Chriſt or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles denyed admittance to any man that deſired to be a member of the Church, though but onely profeſſing to repent and believe; ſo neither did I ever there find that any but convicted Hereticks, or ſcandalous ones (and that for the moſt part after due admonition) were to be avoided, or debarred our fellowſhip. And whereas it is urged, that they are to prove their intereſt to the priviledges that they lay claim to, and not we to deſprove it; I anſwer, If that were granted, yet their meer ſober profeſſing to Repent and believe in Chriſt, is a ſufficient evidence of their intereſt to Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip, and admittance thereto by Baptiſme (ſuppoſing them not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted before:) and their being baptized perſons, (if at age) or members of the univerſal viſible Church, (into which it is that they are baptized) is ſufficient evidence of their intereſt to the Supper, till they do by hereſie, or ſcandall blot that evidence; which evidence if they do produce, yea, though they are yet weak in the faith of Chriſt, who is he that dare refuſe to receive them? And, this after much doubting, diſpute, and ſtudy of the Scriptures, I ſpeak as confidently, as almost any truth of equall moment; ſo plain is the Scripture in this point, to a man that brings his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to the model of Scripture, and doth not bring a model in his brain, and reduce all he reads to that model.</hi> What have I ſpoke more then here is ſaid? and did I ever ſpeak with more and higher confidence? I ſay, that a faith which is ſhort of juſtifying gives title to Baptiſme; and he ſayes, Such give ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient evidence of their intereſt to Church-memberſhip, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:168215:104"/> conſequently admittance to Baptiſme; ſo that if my doctrine herein be looſe, (as he chargeth it) the Reader will hardly find his to be faſt; and it heares not well, to play faſt and looſe. The evaſion of equivocal will not here ſerve, that will utterly ſpoyl the whole ſtrength of his Caution, and put men amain on this ſeparation, as it will contradict his aſſertion, of their grace as real, and true: They will ſay, They will have no fellowſhip with <hi>a dead Corps,</hi> inſtead of <hi>a reall man;</hi> for that is his expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the difference between what is real, and what is equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. Neither can he here come off by the help of his diſtinction of <hi>forum Dei,</hi> and <hi>forum Eccleſiae.</hi> Theſe gifts and graces from God, theſe priviledges vouchſafed of God, and purchaſed by Chriſt, plainly enough ſpeak a right in the ſight of God. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there (as we have heard) in this Controverſie any ſuch diſtinction to be admitted. I am therefore in this no further to blame, then he hath been; and if he ſee cauſe to recede from, yet I ſee all reaſon to perſiſt in my opinion.</p>

                           <hi>there cannot be that vaſt difference and diſproportion between it and baptiſme, that the one ſhould be a priviledge of the Church viſible, and the other pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and proper to the Church inviſible: that all in the outward ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Covenant (as ſome ſpeak) ſhould be intereſſed in the one, and onely thoſe that come up to the termes of the Covenant ſhould have any intereſt in the other.</hi> Chriſt gave order that <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſhould be baptized,</hi> Matth. 28.19. and he delivered his <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Diſciples,</hi> Matth. 26.26, 27. and it is more then ſtrange that diſciples ſhould be taken in that aequivocall way, as to hold out all in outward profeſſion, confoederation. and viſible Church communion, in the one, (as is almoſt generally agreed upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Paedobaptiſts and their adverſaries) and to be reſtrayned to thoſe that anſwer to their profeſſion in the other; ſo that in the adminiſtration of the one, the diſpenſers have a firme rule to lead them, <hi>viz.</hi> viſibility of intereſt (as Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> hath largely ſhewn in his Vindication, pag. 52. Cou. 4.) and in the other can
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:168215:105"/> have nothing for their guide, but an inviſible work, left to their charity to conjecture. <hi>Diſciple</hi> therefore reſpective to either of the Sacraments (which are outward viſible ordinances and viſible Church priviledges) can be no more then a man of viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble intereſt. When Chriſt ſate down to the Paſſeover, it is ſaid <hi>he ſate down with the twelve,</hi> onely they had right to eat of it in his company, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.3. being of his family; And, <hi>as he was eating he gave the Supper,</hi> but then the phraſe is changed, <hi>he gave it to his Diſciples,</hi> onely the twelve were occaſionally there, but it was inſtituted in behalf of all Diſciples, of which the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber could not be ſmall; conſidering how many <hi>John</hi> had made and baptized, and Chriſt had made and baptized more then he, though not in perſon, but by his Diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.1, 2. A reverend brother makes this practice of Chriſt at the firſt inſtitution and adminiſtration of the Supper, to be a directory for future, to receive ſuch onely to it, as are the Diſciples of Chriſt. To which I willingly condeſcend, provided that the word be aright under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. I know the word is ſometimes taken in a reſtrayned ſenſe, for thoſe that indeed do the duty of diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.31. <hi>If ye continue in my word, then are ye my Diſciples indeed;</hi> and, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.33. <hi>Whoſoever he be of you that forſaketh not all that he hath, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be my Diſciple.</hi> As the word <hi>Iſraelite</hi> is ſometimes taken for thoſe that do the duty of Iſraelites, and are ſuch as Iſraelites ought to be, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.47. <hi>Behold, an Iſraelite indeed, in whom there is no guile;</hi> when reſpective to fruition of Church ordinances (of what nature ſoever) all that were of <hi>Iſrael</hi> according to the fleſh or viſible Church-Members in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> are expreſſed by it. <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> or <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> is a man of outward Covenant intereſt. The latitude of it, according to Scripture expreſſions, I have ſhewen, Treatiſe of the Covenant, pag. 208. All that were Chriſts fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Diſciples, did eat of the Paſſeover with him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.18. even <hi>Judas,</hi> as is acknowledged, and ſcarce to be doubted of but he did eat of the Supper. It is more then ſtrange, that as a Diſciple he ſhould be taken into the Paſſeover, and a few houres after, as no Diſciple ſhould be put from the Supper. The Lords Supper is for the building of thoſe that Baptiſme takes in; But Baptiſme takes into the Church viſible. Viſible Church members have then intereſt in the Supper. When Sacraments are in their uſe diſtinguiſhed, one for admittance into the Church, and the other for growth; one as the Sacrament of our birth,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:168215:105"/> and the other our nouriſhment, moſt underſtand the firſt of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into the Church viſible (well knowing that regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not tyed to baptiſme,) but the growth many will have to be in the Church inviſible, which inharmonious diſcord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Ordinances of the ſame kind cannnot be ſuffered. To give notes of the Diſciples of Chriſt, for diſcovery of a Diſciple in the former ſenſe, by their affections to him, and ſuffering of affliction for him, are of ſingular uſe: Chriſt himſelf hath gone before us in it. But upon the notation of the word, becauſe Chriſt gave the Bread and Cup to Diſciples, to make the ſubject of that Sacrament to be onely thoſe that reach theſe markes, is beſides the holy Ghoſts intention. All outward Ordinances are for the Church <hi>in fieri,</hi> and not onely <hi>in facto,</hi> for the bringing of it on to Chriſt. I ſhould deſire to know where any outward ſenſible Ordinance is made, or how in reaſon, and according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it can be made the proper peculiar right of inviſible members.</p>

And though there be characteriſticall differnces, whereby a man in grace, and he that is ſhort of it, may be diſtinguiſhed; whereby all bad ground at the beſt may be differenced from that which is good: yet they are ſuch, whereby a man is to make trial of himſelf, onely they are Spirit-works; and none knowes them in any man ſave the Spirit that
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:168215:106"/> is in him, and therefore no marks for any others cognizance. For a Miniſter of Chriſt to diſpence by command the Sacrament to many, when he knowes that it is of poſſible uſe and benefit to ſome few, unto theſe it is food and nouriſhment unto life; unto the others as Rats-bane, Poyſon, and onely for death; is ſuch a ſnare that may hold him in his adminiſtration, in all hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and amazement. A fad <hi>dilemma,</hi> either to lay aſide an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Chriſt, and ſo never come up in his place to the whole of his duty; or elſe to deliver to them that which will inevitably be the ruine and deſtruction of ſo many of them. I know no poſſible way that can be ſuppoſed, or ſo much as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for avoidance; but in the Name of Chriſt, to give warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all, in whom this new life by the Spirit is not, to abſtain every man and woman not actually regenerate, on their peril to keep off. Let them ſay, ſome know their danger in the higheſt terms that can be uttered, and then if they come, their blood is on their own heads, and the Miniſter of Chriſt hath by this means delivered his ſoul. But to this I have three things to ſay, 1. That it is, (as I ſuppoſe) without all Scripture-precedent, to warn men upon account of want of a new life by the Spirit, wholly to keep off from this, or any other Ordinance of Chriſt. I know we muſt warn men of their ſin, and the judgement hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over their heads for ſin (in which let it be our prayer, that we may be more faithful) but that we ſhould warn men upon this account, upon this very ground, to hold off from all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe to Ordinances, I have not learnt. 2. I ſay, this doth preſuppoſe that which is wont to be denyed, unregenerate men to be in a capacity to examine themſelves reſpective to this Ordinance. How can we warn them upon want of juſtifying faith, and the ſaving work of repentance, to hold back, when they are in an incapacity upon trial to find themſelves thus wanting? 3. Shall we not hereby pluck the thorne out of our own ſides, and as much as in us lyes, thruſt it into the ſides of many of our hungry, thirſty, and poor in ſpirit people? How many may we ſuppoſe are in grace, through a work happily begun on their ſouls? yet for ſeveral reaſons are not able to ſee this grace, or reach to any diſcovery of it. Sometimes by reaſon of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy of the work upon their hearts, being yet babes, or rather embryo's in grace. The firſt that appears upon light received, is an army of luſts and potent corruptions, as we know <hi>Paul</hi>
                           <pb n="191" facs="tcp:168215:106"/> ſets it out. This cloudes for preſent any other weak work, that as yet in preſent is wrought. In this time Satan is not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, he did not ſhew ſo much artifice before to leſſen their ſin, but he now makes uſe of as much to aggravate it: and as he was induſtrious before to ſeduce, now he is as buſie to accuſe. He led the inceſtuous man to incontinency, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.4. And we know <hi>Paul</hi> feares, leaſt upon continuance of the Church-cenſure, he would gain advantage to ſwallow him up in overmuch ſorrow, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8, 11. Theſe perhaps as yet are not able to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the nature of faith and repentance, or their genuine fruits; much leſſe are they able, by a reflex act to conclude the truth of them in their ſouls. Sometimes by reaſon of ſome ſharpe conflict of temptation, being under the ſhock and aſſault of it, and therefore whatſoever they have ſeen of grace hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or the favour of God, now it is under a cloud (which I believe was <hi>Pauls</hi> caſe, when a meſſenger of Satan was ſent to buffet him, and a thorne in the fleſh given him,) ſeeing it is put in oppoſition to the abundance of revelations that he had being taken up into the third heavens, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.) and therefore had need of Ordinances for ſupport. Sometimes on a ſoyle received by temptation, of which his own heart, and not the Church is witneſſe; and therefore is at a loſſe of the joy of his ſalvation, and ſtands in need of ſtrength for recovery. Sometimes by over-much ſloath, and ruſt contracted on his graces through neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, which is ſuppoſed to be the caſe of the ſpouſe indulging her ſelf too much in carnal eaſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2. <hi>I have put off my coat, how ſhall I put it on? I have waſhed my feet, how ſhall I defile them?</hi> Sometimes God out of prerogative, withdrawing the rayes of his Spirit, and refuſing to teſtifie with our ſpirits, in which caſe the ſoul that is moſt upright with God, and ſincere in his feare, walks in darkneſſe and ſees no light; in which there is need of all communications from God, and attendance upon him in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances. When theſe ſhall hear all in whom the work of grace is not in truth, thus warned to keep back, and told of the high danger of approaching to this Table in ſuch away aggravated, will not they put in their name, and ſay their ſouls are now ſpoke to? They muſt therefore abſent themſelves, and ſo the ſmoaking flax is quenched, and the bruiſed reed broke. There, have not been a few hungry ſad ſouls that I have known, that have born the terror of the Lord, ſeparate themſelves for this reaſon. But
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:168215:107"/> it will be replyed by thoſe that give this warning, that they mean not theſe, they are not at all intended in their ſpeech; theſe they would tender, and with all endeared affection of love en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage, as thoſe that have moſt need, and are moſt fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive food, for their ſtrength. But all of this helps not, when this Propoſition is laid down, That <hi>no man in whom juſtifying faith, and a new life by the Spirit is not wrought, may dare, otherwiſe then on the peril of his ſoul,</hi> to draw nigh hither: will not ſuch a ſoul, neceſſarily aſſume? A new life through the Spirit is not wrought in my ſoul; I am conſcious to my ſelf that I am carnal: whatſoever endeavours I have uſed to believe, yet how far am I from faith in ſtrength and truth? I find my ſelf all over doubts and fears, and plunged in unbelief. And though I have made it my buſineſſe to keep off from ſin, yet how far am I from a true change by repentance? I find my heart hard, obdurate, even as an adamant; yea, the poor deſerted ſoul will take to it ſelf the ſtate of <hi>Cain,</hi> the condition of <hi>Judas:</hi> If there be any other high in wickedneſſe, they have matched, yea, they have exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. They are to put it to the queſtion, whether they are in grace or no? whether they have a new life wrought, or as yet are ſhort of it? This they muſt either determine in the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that they are in grace, at leaſt there are thoſe hopeful ſigns in preſent, that they cannot but conclude it, and then they ſafely may come, upon ſight of this they may with cheerfulneſſe make their addreſſe; or elſe they muſt carrie it in the negative, all that is yet wrought is not life, is not grace, is not faith in its power, is not repentance in truth, as they can do no other <hi>that walk in darkneſſe, and ſee no light;</hi> that ſay, <hi>God hath forgotten to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,</hi> and ſo they muſt keep off from the Ordinance, and debar themſelves from thoſe cordials, thoſe apples, thoſe flagons that are there tendered: and <hi>ſick of love,</hi> yet dare not intermeddle with the Lords tokens that are tendered to them: or in the third place ſuſpend, and ſo ſit down in doubtful fears, whether they have grace or no; and then that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23. <hi>He that doubteth, is damned if he eat,</hi> becauſe he eateth not of faith, <hi>for whatſoever is not of faith is ſin,</hi> will ſoon come into their thoughts, and ſo all that are ſhort of fulneſſe of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, muſt in dreadful horror ſeparate themſelves.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, This Sacrament, in that it is a Sacrament, hath the name and nature of a ſeal, (as we ſee in the text, and God willing
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:168215:107"/> ſhall be ſhewn) a viſible ſeal, intruſted in the hands of man; and therefore muſt needs be of a more different latitude and large extent, then that ſeal which God reſerves in his own keeping, the ſeal of the Spirit, The Lord knowes them that are his, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. But man is to ſeek who are the Lords, God knowes how to put to his ſeal to his own; man who hath not this knowledg muſt needs be here allowed a greater latitude; either men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with it, muſt have the knowledge of God as to this particular, who they are in whom a new life is, and grace wrought; or elſe they muſt be allowed a greater latitude to take in men that make profeſſion of God, and as members in Church-Communion may be edified by it: I know this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is carried another way, and that we conclude the contrary upon a double account.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Theſe ſeales of God (outward and inward) ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer each to other. Thoſe that have the outward ſeal, they are to have the inward; thoſe that take into their hand the ſeal of the Sacrament ſhould have the impreſſe of the Spirit on their ſoules. To which I anſwer, That the writing of the Word with Inke and Paper in the Bible, and the writing in the heart by the Spirit, ſhould anſwer each the other: that is, every Chriſtian ſhould make it his buſineſſe, to hide that Word in his heart, that by the Miniſtery ſounds in his ears: and yet Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are not warned, not to take a Bible into their hands, till the impreſſe of that which is there is put on their hearts. The Word is delivered in a greater latitude, and ſo alſo muſt the Sacrament.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Some ſay, this Sacrament ſeales Goſpel-promiſes, onely they therefore that can claime the promiſe, and have their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in it, can claime the ſeal, otherwiſe the <hi>ſeal is put to a blank;</hi> there is a ſeal where there is no Covenant-promiſe. 1. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, this argument thus carried, ſpeaks ſadly to the hearts of all diſpenſers of the Sacraments: they muſt ſee there is a Covenant-promiſe, or elſe they muſt not dare to put to a ſeal. To put any mans ſeal to a blank paper where nothing is written, is a vain uſe of that ſeal; It ſtands there as a cypher: Now to put Gods ſeal to a blank where nothing is written, doubtleſſe is as vain, and an high taking of Gods Name in vain: according to theſe the Covenant is written in non-legible and inviſible characters. (This inward work is <hi>that white ſtone with a new name written, which no
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:168215:108"/> man knoweth ſave he that receives it</hi>) Revel. 2.17. and ſo the diſpenſers too often againſt convictions of conſcience (allwayes at hap-hazard) muſt deliver them, any thing written or not written, whether a blank or filled up, they cannot tells, but are all at uncertainties. 2. I anſwer, as is the ſeal, ſo is the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, both of them external, and one muſt anſwer to the other: Now theſe in queſtion (as hath been demonſtrated at large) are in Covenant, An outward Covenant is by few queſtioned, and ſo the ſeal is put to no blank, but given to one intereſted in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. It ſeals the grace of the Covenant, and mercy tendred in the promiſe on Gods termes and propoſitions. So that the different latitude of the ſeal of the Spirit, and of the ſeal of the Sacrament, do conclude that men of no more then viſible Church-intereſt may partake of it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Church <hi>de facto</hi> hath injoyed it in this latitude, not to inſtance in ſome ages following the times of the Apoſtles, in which the Paſtors called all their people to daily Sacraments, and the uſe of it in <hi>Auſtins</hi> time, when wicked ones in the Church were ſo numerous, that they durſt not deal with Church-cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; but look into the Scripture, though we are kept much in the dark concerning their practice, (little mention being made of the adminiſtration after the inſtitution) yet we know that this Sacrament was the priviledge of viſible members then in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and it is clear enough, how far many, even then were ſhort of ſincerity. If that of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. be well weighed, we may well believe that the Primitive times were not acquainted with the rigour of ſome perſons.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. There is no reaſon that this Ordinance ſhould ſtand alone, that in all other Ordinances there ſhould be a greater latitude, (and men in an unregenerate ſtate admitted, and not held out with limit to men, in whom a life of Sanctification through the Spirit is found) and this alone pent up in ſo narrow a compaſſe. I know ſomewhat is ſaid for the latitude of ſome Ordinances, that all are received to them, becauſe they are Ordinances ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for converſion of men unconverted. But this Plea in many will not ſerve; unregenerate mens admiſſion to prayer, to thankſgiving, to faſts, hath been (that I know) queſtioned by few: And thoſe that deny that the Lords Supper hath any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence to converſion, have not aſſerted theſe to have any ſuch efficacy or power: unregenerate men then muſt be admitted to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:168215:108"/> the Supper, or elſe they muſt be denyed to come to faſts, thanks-giving and prayer. Here ſome do diſtinguiſh between duties naturally Moral, and thoſe that are of meer poſitive inſtitution. Moral duties, as prayer, thankſgiving, &amp;c. are confeſt to belong in general unto all, but it is not ſo (as is objected) in duties of poſitive inſtitution; they are given with limit to ſome, and are not of univerſal obligation. To which I anſwer, 1. By way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, poſitive Precepts bind not all, becauſe they are not given to all: the Gentile Nations were not tied to the Law of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies given to the Jewes, and meer Heathens are not now tied to our Sacraments. 2. For a poſitive anſwer I ſay, Poſitive Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts were never given in charge with any ſuch diſtinction as to bind the regenerate, and to exclude men in unregeneration. Men under ſin, and in nature, are bound to the affirmative part of the ſecond Commandement, to obſerve every way of worſhip that ſhall be inſtituted by God: all of which are onely of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive right. All <hi>Iſrael</hi> were tied to ſacrifice, as well as to hear, and pray; it was a ſin not to ſacrifice, as not to fear an oath, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.2. And all Chriſtians are now under an obligation to the Law of the Sacraments, as they are to other duties. And as to the thing in hand, this diſtinction of Moral, and Poſitive du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (as I conceive) is of no uſe; for the poſitive Command be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given, there is a Moral tie to yeeld obedience. Inſtance may be given in purely Ceremonial Precepts, that are ſeconded with this ſanction, <hi>I am the Lord,</hi> Levit. 19.23, 24, 25. So that when a Precept meerly Ceremonial was broke, immediately, yet the firſt Command was broken interpretatively, and by way of neceſſary conſequence, the Law of nature tied <hi>Adam</hi> to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from the forbidden fruit, when God had given him a Precept not to eat of it; and the young man in the Goſpel was alſo bound to ſell all that he had, and give it to the poor, when Chriſt had manifeſted that it was his pleaſure. There are texts indeed produced, ſeemingly taken of men under ſin, from the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of poſitive duties, as, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.23, 24. and as much may be ſaid concerning thoſe that are Moral, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.2, 3.20.2, 3. We read that the ſacrifices of the wicked are an abomination, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.8. &amp; 21.27. and as much is ſaid of their prayers, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.9.

                        <p>Fifthly, This limit of the Lords Supper to regenerate perſons, as on the one hand it will take with the conſciences of many ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified Chriſtians, to hold them back, as hath been ſaid, even with all that ſtand ſhort of aſſurance of grace; ſo on the other hand it will give encouragement to many unſanctified ones, to make addreſſe to it: Broken hearts under the body of ſin having not yet attained to the light of Gods ſmiling face, will be ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in their own cenſure, as to hold themſelves back. The generation of formal Profeſſors pure in their own eyes, and not yet cleanſed from their filthineſſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.11. will flock to it. So that we muſt either find ſome other more ſure rule, or elſe the hearts of many precious ones, whom God would not have made ſad, will be ſadned, and the hands of many in ſin, upon their admiſſion, will be ſtrengthned.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Objections anſwered.</note> I know there are Objections even without number multiplyed, againſt this that I have here delivered, and ſuch that have taken with very many, to carry them to determine the Point in hand in a contrary way: And in caſe I had not ſeen that the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of them is more and more diſcerned, and that by men of eminent parts and integrity, I ſhould have been by the multitude as well of Objections, as Objectors, diſcouraged to appear againſt them. <hi>The duties of the Lords Supper are ſuch,</hi> (ſay ſome) <hi>that onely the ſincere ſervants of Chriſt, that are ſanctified by Chriſt, are able to perform. The mercies of the Sacrament are ſuch, as they onely can receive;</hi> and therefore onely theſe are the fit ſubjects of it. And theſe are driven on very far. <hi>The duties preparatory to the work, cannot be done by others,</hi> (as is objected) <hi>as ſelf-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ſelf-judging. The duties executory cannot be done, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the work it ſelf.</hi> How ſpecious ſoever this argument appears, and I doubt not but it is with all ſincerity of heart and integrity urged, yet I deſire it may yet be further conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</p>
                        <p>Firſt, That this Argument, thus urged, doth diſable all men not ſanctified from all other duties by the command of God incumbent upon them, as well as from this duty; they muſt upon this account exclude themſelves from every Ordinance enjoyned of God as well as from this; put the argument into form, and this will eaſily appear. They that cannot do the duties charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe that are put upon a work, nor receive the mercies given in promiſe to it, are to be excluded from it: Now as theſe
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:168215:109"/> aſſume, An unſanctified man cannot diſcharge the duties, nor receive the comforts of a Communicant; ſo will I with equal reaſon aſſume, That an unſanctified man cannot perform the duties charged upon the hearers of the Word, upon him that calls upon the Name of God, or returns thanks to him; He cannot perform the duties that are charged puon him; that is, to ſanctifie the Sabbath, to meditate, to inſtruct his family, rebuke his brother, give almes, follow the duties of his calling. No unſanctified man does all that is required in the performance of any of theſe, neither is any fit to receive the mercies of theſe duties, that is unfit to receive the mercies of that duty; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it followes that he muſt neither hear, pray, give thanks, ſanctifie the Sabbath, inſtruct or reprove any, give almes, labour in his Calling, or any other work. If any think to come off by way of diſtinction, That there is difference between this and other duties; Then the diſtinction ſhould have been put into the Propoſition, and it not delivered in that generality; and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever that diſtinction ſhall be put, I ſhall not doubt but an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in the diſtinction will be ſuggeſted.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Inabilities to perform duties, upon the bare ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of natural corruption, in a right way, and in that accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner, as to receive the comforts of them, do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge a man from obligation to the duty: In caſe indeed it could be proved, that God never gave the Sacrament in charge to an unſanctified man, but left this viſible Ordinance, as a Legacy or charge to an inviſible Society, whom none but themſelves, can diſtinguiſh, and few of them able to diſtinguiſh themſelves then the argument were of ſome force; but from the inability to reaſon againſt obligation to the duty, to take men off from it upon that account of weakneſſe through natural corruption, will take all men off that are unregenerate from all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Thoſe that in this way diſable all men in nature from theſe duties which are given in charge to a Communicant, upon that ground to keep them from the Sacraments, yet confeſſe they may do this work in order at leaſt to their own excluſion; they cannot examine themſelves in order to receive, but they may and muſt examine themſelves in order to hold themſelves off from it. When the Apoſtle ſpeaks to the whole viſible Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> expreſſely, <hi>Let a man examine himſelf, and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:168215:110"/> ſo let him eat of this bread, and drink of this cup.</hi> This few (ſay they) can reach; but to examine, and not to eat, is in the power of all the other.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, Though theſe reach not the higheſt duties, and ſo come not up to the ultimate end of the Sacrament, yet they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in their meaſure ſeveral duties, and reach the intermediate and ſubordinate end of it. <hi>They ſee Chriſt there evidently ſet forth, and crucified before them:</hi> There they ſee the higheſt ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of ſin, <hi>Chriſt wounded for ſin, bruiſed for tranſgreſſion,</hi> under the Fathers wrath for mans guilt, ſuffering for ſin, <hi>the juſt for the unjuſt.</hi> They ſee him bearing the ſins of many, and they cannot nor may not exclude themſelves from the number. They ſee there a ranſome paid for ſin, a diſcharge made to the Fathers Juſtice. They ſee Chriſt tendered, and offered: They may further oblige themſelves to all duties required, as well to the intereſting grace, which is faith, as to the qualifications of obedience; They do believe, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.12, 13. <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.42, 43. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. This faith is true in its kind, they do not onely yeeld aſſent, but reach to ſome meaſure of joy, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13. They are in Chriſt, their way of inheſion or implantation I ſhall not determine; But in the latitude as he is an head, he hath members that are inherent in him, he is an head of a Church viſible, and hath many members ſuitable, as the Reader may ſee in <hi>Cobbet</hi> of Infant-Baptiſme, Concluſ. 5. pag. 56. Whileſt thoſe hearers mentioned, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13. believed, I cannot think it was the ſeeds-mans office, who had ſounded the Word in their ears, to have withheld the viſible Word from their eyes, or adviſed them to have withdrawn themſelves. And as they do duties incumbent on Communicants, ſo alſo they receive mercies, many intermediate mercies, though in that ſtate they receive not the higheſt and choiceſt mercies. They par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the fatneſſe of the Olive, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. even all that come into that ſtate that the blinded Jewes, and the worſt part among them did relinquiſh.</p>

Not as an Apoſtolical Canon, (as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> in his Eccleſiaſtical Policy hath obſerved; for then, if the Apoſtle had been ſilent, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction had not been obliging) but as a neceſſary reſult from all that they had in charge from Jeſus Chriſt; Prophecie exceeds unknown tongues, becauſe it edifies, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.4. And unknown tongues are without profit, and of no uſe, without interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to edifie, ver. 5. Therefore we have the Apoſtles reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for publique prayers, ver. 14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my ſpirit prayeth, but my underſtanding is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull: what is it then? I will pray with the Spirit, and with underſtanding alſo; I will ſing with the Spirit, and I will ſing with the underſtanding alſo. Elſe when thou ſhalt bleſſe with the Spirit, how ſhall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned, ſay Amen at thy giving of thanks? ſeeing he underſtandeth not what thou ſayeſt; for thou verily giveſt thankes well, but the other is not edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> And for the preaching of the Word, ver. 18, 19. <hi>I thank my God, I ſpeak with tongues more then you all; yet in the Church I had rather ſpeak five words with my underſtanding, that by my voice I might teach others alſo, then ten thouſand words in an unknown tongue.</hi> Matters circumſtantiall, and of themſelves indifferent, if they be not reduced to this end, prove inexpedient, and to the doer evil. <hi>All things are lawful for me, but all thinges edifie not,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.23. The whole of the Miniſterial work, and every appendant to it muſt be reduced hither; what have builders to do but to edifie? And if they edifie not, what do they do? In what other metaphor ſoever their work is ſet out, this is ſtill their buſineſſe, <hi>the perfecting of the Saints, the edifying of the body of Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 4.12. When they have done this, and made it their whole buſineſſe, they may with confidence ſpeak to God in the words of Chriſt, <hi>I have glorified thee, I have finiſhed the work that thou gaveſt me to do,</hi> Joh. 17.5. This thread, which runs through
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:168215:111"/> the whole of the Miniſteriall work, is not to be excluded here. Thoſe of whom there is hopes that they are willing to learn Chriſt, are to be taken into Chriſts School by Baptiſme, and thoſe are to be admitted to the Lords Supper that knowingly will engage for continuance, and comming on in the waies of Chriſt. Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is the entry door into the Church viſible; no man muſt be refuſed of whom there is reaſon of expectation that they will be profeſſedly Chriſts. And the Lords Supper is the means of the growth of thoſe that are thus viſibly and in the face of the Church received; where this may conduce to their building up, it is not to be denyed, ſo that the diſpenſers great enquiry muſt be, whom the Lords Supper may benefit, where it may edifie? which according to Scripture rules may be diſcerned and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, otherwiſe the Apoſtle had not given this charge, <hi>Let all things be done to edification;</hi> and where it may edifie, to give it; and where it ſerves not for edification, to forbear it; not whether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate or unregenerate (which is an undiſcernable work), and accordingly to admit or refuſe.</p>

                        <p>Firſt, Men of that intereſt, that baptiſme receives, as the intention of the work in order to ſalvation; theſe the Lords Supper ſerves, to carry on by ſanctification to ſalvation, as the end of the work likewiſe: But Baptiſme receives men of viſible profeſſion onely, and viſible intereſt, as the intention of the work into the viſible Church in order to ſalvation: Therefore the Lords Supper car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on theſe by ſanctification, as the intention of the work to ſalvation. The Propoſition cannot be denyed, unleſſe we will
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:168215:111"/> without reaſon, bring in that vaſt difference between theſe two outward v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>
                           </gap>ble Ordinances, both intruſted in the hands of man, as that the one ſhall be of that latitude to receive men of viſible intereſt, and the other reſtrained to inviſible members; The one according to the mind of God ſhall let many into the Church for ſalvation, the other ſhall be in capacity to nouriſh, and bring on very few. The Aſſumption cannot be denyed, That Baptiſme receives men of viſible profeſſion and viſible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in order to ſalvation, and hath been abundantly proved: we baptize infants upon the bare account of Covenant-holineſs, which is onely a viſible intereſt: men of years were baptized, (and by juſt warrant yet may, in caſe not baptized) upon a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible profeſſion. The concluſion then followes, that the Lords Supper carries on thoſe as the intention of the work, that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme receives to ſalvation.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, If it be the mind of God in the Goſpel revealed, that men of viſible intereſt having not yet attained to the grace of ſanctification ſhould have admittance to the Lords Table, then it muſt needs follow that it ſerves as an inſtrument with the Word to raiſe them up by faith, and ſanctification to ſalvation: But it is the mind of God in the Goſpell revealed, that men of viſible intereſt having not yet reached unto ſanctification, ſhould have admittance to the Lords Supper: The Lords Supper then ſerves to raiſe up men of viſible intereſt by faith and ſanctification for ſalvation. The Propoſition is clear, unleſſe we will make mens admiſſion (moſt mens admiſſion) meerly vain, having no power, nor any capacity to advance their happineſſe, but being wholly in a tendency to increaſe their judgement. Whatſoever the ſecret will of God (to us unknown) is, that in the event it ſhall prove; yet the work it ſelf muſt have a tendency and power, reſpective to thoſe for whom it is appointed, for edification, not for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. The Aſſumption is evident (that thoſe of viſible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, having not attained ſanctification, according to the mind of God revealed in his Word, ſhould have admittance) by the barres that are aſſigned for mens excluſion. The alone barres that are ordinarily aſſigned, to hold men in Covenant-intereſt off from the Lords Table, are ignorance, Error, and Scandal: But many that cannot be charged with ignorance, error, or ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, are yet ſhort of ſanctification: Many ſhort of ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then have no barre to their admiſſion. Either viſible intereſt,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:168215:112"/> with capacity to improve it, or ſaving intereſt in the Covenant muſt be the rule for admiſſion: But ſaving intereſt in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

God never puts mens charity to this work, (as reſpective to admiſſion to ordinances) to judge, whether in grace or not, whether regenerate or in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regeneration. And indeed charity (which is aſſigned by ſome to that place) is moſt unfit to judge. A Judge, or Umpire in a buſineſſe muſt be impartial, and have nothing to byaſſe him on any hand. But charity would be ready to cover a multitude of ſins, which is no blemiſh of the grace, but a demonſtration that this is none of its office. If then man muſt judge, (as he is moſt unmeet) his reaſon, and not his love muſt take the chair for it, and go as high as conjecture can reach. 2. If charity or reaſon thus ſet up miſtake, then the rule is broke; which though theſe will ſay is not the admitters ſin, ſeeing the thing is not ſo <hi>ſcibile,</hi> or of poſſibility to be known, (and by the way we obſerve that he is therefore no competent Judge) yet a ſeal is by this meanes put to a blank, which is no ſmall prophanation, and the ordinance adminiſtred ſolely and neceſſarily for the receivers judgement. 3. Though we infallibly know a mans unſanctified condition, and were able to charge it; yet whileſt it is not open, and breakes not into ſcandal, we cannot upon this account (as is confeſt) exclude him from the Sacrament. That <hi>Judas</hi> received the Sacrament of the Lords Supper moſt of the Ancient held, as <hi>Maldonate</hi> on <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.6. obſerves; we have large liſts brought to our hands of names that go that way. The greater part of late Writers are of the ſame mind; <hi>Ravanellus</hi> as the laſt man, in verb. Sacrament is peremptory in it, and there concludes
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:168215:112"/> alſo the intereſt of all in Covenant, yet <hi>Judas</hi> was known to Chriſt, to be a thief, a Devil, and yet he receives him. Chriſt had doubtleſſe power veſted in him for his excluſion. The non-ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apoſtles, nor the cloſe carriage of his treachery, could not then have excuſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>d his receiving, in caſe it had not been the mind of God that a man of viſible intereſt, though unſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, might be admitted. And to ſay that Chriſt acted here as a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and it was not fit that he ſhould be both Judge and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, though it be a truth, yet it ſerves not to take off the Argument. Had it not been the mind of God that men of his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ſhould be received, then Chriſt would not at any hand have knowingly gone againſt it, and given him admiſſion to it. And what he did, according to the mind of God as a Miniſter, by a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter may be done. And to pronounce him at that time, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, ſuch that had no right for admiſſion, yet to admit him, were ſuch a precedent as Chriſt would not have given. Chriſt would not truſt himſelf with ſome upon that account, <hi>that the knew what was in them,</hi> Joh. 2.23, 24. and he would not have truſted the Sacrament with ſuch a one, in caſe he had not known that it had been the mind of God, that men of that ſtanding ſhould partake of it. If it be objected, that Chriſt knew that <hi>Judas</hi> was not in a capacity to improve the Sacrament for ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and ſalvation, being a reprobate: I anſwer, reſpective to his gifts wherewith he was endowed, he was in capacity of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement. The Sacrament is of uſe to thoſe that were his infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, and an eye is had to the tendency of the work according to Gods revealed will, and not to that which is in Gods ſecret purpoſe. Let us ſumme up the argument briefly into this form, Miniſters muſt give the Sacrament, ſo as it may be to edification and not certainly to deſtruction: But they muſt give it to ſome not yet throughly ſanctified: Therefore ſome not throughly ſanctified may receive it to edification, and not to deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly the Law and Goſpel in their joynt ſtrength, applyed in power to the underſtanding, may work men of Covenant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt up to the terms, conditions, and propoſitions of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: may work men of profeſſion of faith, to faith ſaving, and juſtifying: may work a man that is onely in name the Lords, to be truely and ſavingly his. This none can deny, if Law and Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel cannot do it, in the way of inſtruments, and ordinances ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:168215:113"/> of God, there is no way on earth in which it can be done: But in the Lords Supper there is Law and Goſpel, the epitome and ſumme, the ſtrength and vigour of Law and Goſpel, applyed in power to the underſtanding: Therefore the concluſion followes, that the Lords Supper may work men of Covenant intereſt up to the terms of the Covenant, men of profeſſion of Faith to Faith ſaving and juſtified. The Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is clear, that in the Lords Supper there is Law and Goſpel, the epitome and ſumme, the ſtrength and vigour both of Law and Goſpell. There we have the curſe of the Law in the higheſt degree held out, Chriſt made a curſe, and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all that the Law denounces againſt ſin, even all that which ſinne according to the Law did demerit. There are ſins bruiſes, tranſgreſſions wounds. There we have the ſumme and ſubſtance of the Goſpel held out, Chriſts death for remiſſion of ſinne laid open. There we have Chriſt a curſe, which is that which the law inflicts upon tranſgreſſion. There we have Chriſt a ſacrifice, which is that which the Goſpel doth promiſe; all brought home, and applyed to the underſtanding of the communicant.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, That which is high in the aggravating of ſinne to the conſcience, and clear in holding out the pardon of ſinne, may work a man of Covenant intereſt up to the terms and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Covenant, may work men of profeſſion of Faith to a Faith ſaving and juſtifying. This is clear, which way elſe are men brought up to faith and ſanctification but upon the ſight of ſinne, in its aggravations, and Goſpel tenders for the removal of it? The Aſſumption, that ſin is in this ordinance in the higheſt way aggravated, and the removal of it held out, is alſo clear, and may eaſily <hi>per partes</hi> be proved. 1. The higheſt ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of ſin to the breaking of the heart, and the melting of the ſoul is the looking upon him whom our ſins have pierced, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. <hi>They ſhall look upon him whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his onely ſonne, and ſhall be in bitterneſſe for him, as one that is in bitterneſſe for his firſt-born;</hi> and that we thus look upon him in the Sacrament; I ſhall chooſe to ſet it out in the words of the Miniſters, and Elders met in the Provinciall Aſſembly of <hi>London</hi> in their Vindication, where ſpeaking to thoſe that joyn with them at the Lords Table, pag. 104. <hi>You muſt ſo remember Chriſt, as to find power coming out of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:168215:113"/> Chriſt Sacramental, to break your hearts for all the ſins you have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt him. Chriſt is preſented in the Sacrament, as a broken Chriſt, his body broken, and his blood poured out. And the very breaking of the bread, underſtandingly looked upon, is a forcible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to break your hearts. Was Jeſus Chriſt rent and torn in pieces for you, and ſhall it not break your hearts that you ſhould ſin againſt him? Was he crucified for you, and will you crucify him by your ſins? And beſides, the breaking of the bread is not onely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to be a motive unto brokenneſſe of heart for ſin, but alſo in the right uſe to effect that which it doth move unto.</hi> And, pag. 105. <hi>You muſt ſo remember Chriſt Sacramentall, as to find power comming out of Chriſt, to ſubdue all your ſins and iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as the diſeaſed woman felt vertue coming out of Chriſt to cure her bloody iſſue: ſo there is power in an applicative and fiducial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Chriſt at the Sacrament, to heal all the ſinful iſſues of our ſoules; there is no ſin ſo ſtrong but it is conquerable by a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er derived from Chriſt crucified.</hi> And, pag. 106. <hi>You muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in remembring Chriſt in the Sacrament, till your hearts be wrought up to a through contempt of the world, and all worldly things. Chriſt inſtituted the Sacrament when he was going out of the world: and when he was crucifying, the whole world was in darkneſſe and obſcurity: and he is propounded in the Sacrament, as a perſecuted, broken crucified Chriſt, deſpiſing, and being deſpiſed of the World. And if you do practically remember the Sacrament of his death, you will find vertue coming out thereof to make you dead to the world, and all worldly things.</hi> And, pag. 107. <hi>Ceaſe not remembring Chriſt, till you be made partakers of the rare grace of humility. Of all the graces that were in Chriſt in which he would have Chriſtians to imitate him in, humility is one of the chiefeſt,</hi> Matth. 11.29. <hi>Learn of me, for I am humble. And Chriſt in the Sacrament is preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as humbling himſelf to the death of the croſſe for our ſakes. And what a ſhame is it to remember an humble. Chriſt with a proud heart? The practical remembrance of the humility of Chriſt Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, when ſanctified, is mighty in operation to tame the pride of our hearts.</hi> And, pag. 110. <hi>To endeavour that your eyes may affect your hearts, when you are at the Sacrament. For as Chriſt in the Miniſtery of his Word, preacheth to the ear, and by the ear convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf into the heart: ſo in the Sacrament he preacheth to the eye, and by the eye conveyeth himſelf into the heart. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is well called a viſible Sermon.</hi> What can be more plain
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:168215:114"/> then this to ſet the out the power of the Sacrament to ſoul contrition, true humiliation, and mortification? Too many that profeſſe Faith have their hearts lift up, and live not by faith. Here is a way to bring them down, when they ſee ſin to be of ſuch a provoking nature, that onely the ſufferings of the Sonne of God are able to ſatisfie, that their demerit doth put him upon a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of all theſe woes. Theſe are certainly heart melting conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations. If it be yet objected, that the Provincial Aſſembly at <hi>London</hi> ſpeak to their own communicants, whom they ſuppoſe to be in grace. To this I reply, that in caſe that ſhould fail, and ſome at leaſt ſhould have their predominant luſts lurking, and treachery againſt the Covenant (as in <hi>Judas</hi> againſt Chriſt) har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured, it can be of no danger, to ſay that here is a means to work them on to humiliation, and brokenneſſe of ſpirit. 2. If any yet ſay, that their thoughts are otherwiſe of this Sacrament: I anſwer, their words beſt ſpeak their thoughts, and we ſee what they ſay. The very breaking of the bread (ſay they) underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly looked upon, is a forcible Argument to break your hearts, and the breaking of the bread may be looked upon underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly by an unſanctified man: if there be truth in their Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as I doubt not but they are moſt true, then my Concluſion is true likewiſe. We may make up (if you pleaſe) this part of the Argument thus: A ſin aggravating ordinance is an heart brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and ſoul humbling ordinance: But the Sacrament of the Lords ſupper is a ſinne aggravating ordinance: Therefore it is an heart breaking and ſoul humbling ordinance. For the other branch of the Aſſumption, that this ordinance is the holding out of the pardon of ſin, needs no proof. This is my blood in the New Teſtament ſhed for you, and for many, for the remiſſion of ſinne, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, That which is annext to the Word to ſecond it, in that very thing, which works the ſoul unto converſion to good, may bring the perſon of Covenant intereſt, up to the termes of the Covenant; may work one of profeſſion of faith onely, unto faith ſaving, and juſtifying. This none can deny: being added to the Word, as it's ſecond in ſuch a work, it well may have an hand in the working of it: But the Sacrament is annext to the Word, to ſecond it in that very thing, which works the ſoul unto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to God. The Aſſumption is manifeſt: If we conſider what the Word does for converſion, and the whole, in which the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:168215:114"/> energy and power of it (as an Ordinance) is exerciſed, then we ſhall ſoon ſee, that this Sacrament is added, as a ſecond in that work. The Word converts, in holding out ſin in its defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and danger; in the diſcovery of the loathſome nature of it, and the curſed effects that follow upon it; together with Chriſt in the promiſes to ſave from it. I know no other way that the Word hath to bring a ſoul in ſin to God, but in ſetting forth the loſt and undone condition of it, and ſo to bring to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, compunction, and enquiry what to do; and then to make tender of Chriſt. In this method, ſouls (as we find on record) have been brought home to God, of which there might be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent inſtances. Now that this Sacrament is added to the Word, for further diſcovery of ſin, in the defilement and danger: to hold out Chriſt in his death, taking away ſin, need not to be proved. It is true that the firſt detection of ſin is by the rule of the Law, and therefore the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>By the Law is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſin.</hi> In caſe the queſtion be put, whether this, or that act be ſin? then neither the tender of Chriſt in the Goſpel, nor yet the Sacrament can have any hand in the determination of it; but they both ſerve for the aggravation of ſin, to lay it open in the dimenſions and danger of it. Sin is no where ſo ſeen in its height, as in the ſorrowes and ſufferings of Chriſt, as is by all affirmed, and theſe ſufferings we know the Word holds out for converſion from ſin. And the viſible Word of the Sacrament ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds the Word in this very thing, to ſet out Chriſts death, to lay before our eyes Chriſt broken for us, both for the aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſin, and for the pardon of it. Thus if you pleaſe you may put the argument; If the Sacrament doth the ſame thing as the Word doth in converſion, then the Sacrament cannot be denyed to have an hand in converſion: But the Sacrament (as we ſee) does the ſame thing as the Word; it ſerves to the heightning of ſin, and the ſetting out of the pardon of ſin: Therefore it followes that the Sacrament may have an hand in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, That which by frequent experience we ſee the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment works toward, and for ought we are able to judge works unto, that we may well conclude, it is deſigned and appointed of God to work. This cannot fairly be denyed; yet if any think that this of it ſelf is not of full ſtrength, ſeeing our expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience may deceive us, we may conceive what is not, Let theſe
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:168215:115"/> then joyn to it what hath been already ſaid. This experience added to ſo much evidence of reaſon, I doubt not but will be found to have ſtrength in it. And I put it for their ſakes that ſay, Let any give inſtance of any man or woman that hath at any time been converted by the Sacrament. And that there are frequent experiences of the Sacraments working towards this thing is plain. How frequent is it with men to have affrightings, ſoul-ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, tremblings, ſtrong preſent reſolutions againſt ſin, upon their approach to this Ordinance? being convinced of it to be a duty, that they ought to go to it. How mightily are their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits often affected in it? If we make that an argument of the power of the Word towards wicked men in the affrighting and aſtoniſhment of them, in the terrifying and amazement, ſtopping for preſent their full ſwinge in ſin and wickedneſſe, as we know it is ordinarily with thoſe that ſet out the power of the Word: ſee Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. pag. 150. why then ſhould we not make the ſame effects that we ſee ordinarily produced by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, to be evidences of the like power in the Sacrament? And as we read of an <hi>Ahab,</hi> a <hi>Felix,</hi> a <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> an <hi>Herod</hi> thus ſtartled by the Word: ſo we may ſee and know ſuch as theſe alike ſtartled and affected at the Sacrament. Superſtition per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps works it in ſome: But we find the work in others, in whom ſuch ſuperſtition hath no place. It can be no other then the Majeſtie of the Ordinance, the high aggravation of ſin, and the glory of Chriſt ſet out in it. All this I confeſſe many times comes to nothing, it is a fit and ſo over; it hath not the ſtrength to bear down mens luſts to a full change, and through morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and ſo it is with thoſe alſo that hear the Word. They are many times Sermon-ſick, and yet all ſoon falls and comes to nothing; yet in the nature of the work it ſelf it hath a tendency towards a change. And that this ſometimes works thoſe of Covenant-intereſt unto a true change, and through work of ſanctification (ſo far as we are able to judge,) there are not few experiments; I have known ſome bred onely for jollity and outward delights, that making addreſſe to the Sacrament have had thoſe ſoul-ſhakings and trembling amazements, that have put them upon a ſerious way of enquiry, and the ſpark ſo kindled by Gods bleſſing, hath been nouriſhed up into that burning heat, that their whole life hath been ſpent in zeal for God, and their name in life and death precious.</p>

                        <p>Seventhly, To theſe we add, the acknowledgement of eminent Divines of an oppoſite judgement, who will have all admitted, preſent at the conſecration of the elements, to ſee the bread broke and divided. And to what purpoſe is their preſence, if not for their profit? and what profit can an unconverted man find in any thing in a ſpiritual way, that works not towards his converſion, that is no wayes uſeful or improvable for it? What others may judge I know not; theſe arguments to which ſome other might be added, have taken with me to conclude the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition before delivered.</p>

                        <p>I Know that objections here are multiplied. I have read many, which in caſe they had been with me of weight, this that I am now upon, had been ſtifled in the birth, and more doubtles hath been ſaid then I have ſeen, and more yet happily will be raiſed. To go about to meet with all were to make no end of words: I ſhall ſpeak firſt to ſome general charges,<note place="margin">General char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges anſwerd.</note> after to ſome particular arguments.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, In caſe this holds, (ſay ſome) then <hi>all upon that bare ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count are to be admitted to the Supper, who will hinder the converſion of any? yea even Turks, Pagans, and the vileſt varlots, may then come and joyn in this Ordinance.</hi> To theſe I anſwer,</p>
                        <p>Firſt, Were it of power,<note place="margin">Promiſcous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion follows not from it.</note> as an inſtrument in the hand of God for converſion of all, yet all were not to be admitted, when the will and mind of God is known to be againſt it: The Goſpel in the mouthes of the twelve, when they had their firſt commiſſion, might have been of power for the converſion of Samaritanes and Gentiles, yet they are forbidden to make tender of it to them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.5. <hi>Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any City of the Samaritanes enter not.</hi> The word in <hi>Pauls</hi> mouth might have been (reſpective to any operation in it ſelf) the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſouls in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Bithynia,</hi> as well as in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> yet the Spirit forbids them to go to the former, and ſends them to preach to the other, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.6.7, 10. <hi>If the mighty works
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:168215:116"/> which were done in Chorazin and Bethſaida, had been done in Tyre and Sidon they would hav repented in ſackcloth and aſhes;</hi> yet they were denyed to thoſe of Tyre and Sidon, Matth. 11.21. So that though the Sacraments had a generally converting pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, yet in caſe they be appointed of God with limit to thoſe of Covenant-intereſt, they may not in any greater latitude be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed, and ſo Jewes, Turkes, and Pagans are excluded.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The Word it ſelf (which is confeſt to be the power of God to ſalvation, and of the moſt large efficacy of any Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for converſion) is not yet tendred to all, in any expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of converſion by it. Not to ſpeak of thoſe to whom God in his providence doth deny it, (who are out of the pale of the Church) but thoſe, to whom the Church doth not make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it: Infants, Idiots, diſtracted ones, and deaf perſons, no Miniſter applies himſelf to them, to make tender of it for conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; ſo that there muſt be not onely a commiſſion to tender it, and a clear evidence, that men have (according to the mind of God) an intereſt, but there muſt be a preſent capacity in ſuch for improvement. I am not ignorant that ſome (ſeeing it ſeems that this doth lye againſt them) have pleaded for a capacity in all theſe before mentioned, to receive benefit by the Word, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 1. <hi>Why are Infants, and</hi> pari ratione <hi>diſtracted perſons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of the Word?</hi> An anſwer me thinks is at hand, becauſe they are neceſſarily in the condition of the high-way-ground, to hear and underſtand nothing. They profit no more then thoſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. that hear words in an unknown tongue. And in caſe they be in capacity (as is affirmed) to receive benefit from the Word, the Miniſter occaſionally is to make out a word of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to them, giving them their portion as well as others; which how it would ſound in the ears of thoſe that are of growth, and have their ſenſes and underſtanding, let any judge. Theſe further demand, <hi>Where hath God ſaid they ſhall be kept from it?</hi> No more hath he ſaid that the ſwallow, or the ſparrow ſhould be kept from it; by providenee they have been preſent, when thoſe that would have improved ſuch an opportunity in a Spiritual way, have been denyed it. Yea, places are produced to ſhew that God hath commanded infants to be preſent at Ordinances. But where is it commanded that Idiots, diſtracted perſons, &amp;c. ſhould be preſent? Reaſons may be given of infants preſence at entry of Covenants, at ſolemn faſts, denuntiations of bleſſings and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:168215:116"/> curſes, when yet they are in an incapacity to receive benefit by the VVord. Demand is yet further made, <hi>Who knowes how God may work at the Word, though not by the Word? may not the Word be an occaſion of converſion unto infants, which is an inſtrument of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to elder perſons?</hi> Such queries will bring in the moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and ſcandalous to the Lords Supper; who knowes but that which is an inſtrument of nouriſhment of men converted, may prove an occaſion of converſion to men unconverted? So that this notwithſtanding the poſition delivered will not bear this inference that is drawn from it. Though the Lords Supper (as an appendant to the Word) may ſerve to bring up thoſe of Covenant-intereſt to the terms and Propoſitions of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; may work a man of profeſſion of faith, to faith ſaving and juſtifying, yet there muſt be ſomewhat more to give actual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to it. Put in theſe two Cautions. 1. That the perſons in queſtion have their intereſt and firſt right in it. 2. That they be in a capacity to improve it for their benefit; with theſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and not elſe, I am for a general admiſſion.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, It is objected, That <hi>this makes the Lords Supper to be a converting Ordinance as well as the Word, and how great an odium lyes upon that opinion, what thoſe be that maintain it, and what intereſt they drive, is very well known.</hi> To this I anſwer: The expreſſion of a Converting Ordinance may be taken two wayes: Firſt, As having power of it ſelf,<note place="margin">In what ſenſe, and with what limit, the Lords Supper may be called a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</note> as a ſingle inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the hand of God, in his ordinary way to work a change in the heart or life. In this ſenſe the converting power of it is to be denyed. Secondly, As having ſome influence for that work as ſeconding and working with the Word, ſo I doubt not but that it may ſafely be owned, and eaſily juſtified. I ſhall lay down my whole thoughts of it in ſome Propoſitions.<note place="margin">Explicatory Propoſitions. Affirmat.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Firſt, In the Affirmative.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, This Sacrament carries the ſoul on towards converſion, in doing the ſame thing as the Word does for converſion, in holding forth Chriſt crucified, in holding him out as our ſin, and as our Saviour, made a curſe for us, and delivering us from the curſe.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, In further engaging the ſoul, or the ſoul upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Sacrament engaging it ſelf to that which the Word requires and calls for. If Covenants in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> entred by refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Princes, were judged to be of that force for obligation of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:168215:117"/> the ſoul to a change in their wayes, putting ſtronger tyes on their ſlippery hearts, much more may we believe that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments in a due order received, may have this efficacious power. <hi>They ſerve</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Hooker) as bonds of obedience to God, ſtrict obligations to the mutual exerciſe of Chriſtian charity, provocations to godlineſſe, preſervations from ſin, memorials of the principal benefits of Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, The Sacrament doth this in an ordinary way accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the revealed will of God in his Word, as the proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the work, and not as any thing extraordinary.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, The Sacrament it ſelf doth it, in that relation in which it ſtands to the Word, in its being and operation; and not the Sacramentals onely, (as they have been called) as the Word preached, and prayer, which yet have a mighty influence on the Sacraments for this work.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, It works as a ſecond to the Word for habitual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, as well as actual; In the way that the Word doth work, for the infuſion of the firſt grace, and not barely for the exciting and ſtirring up of grace in the ſoul. Their way of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I ſhall God willing in due place further enquire into.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Negat.</note>Secondly, In the Negative.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, The Sacrament converts none by the bare work done. There is no ſuch power by receiving, to change the ſoul, as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts believe there is by conſecration to change the elements. There is neither reaſon for it, nor promiſe of it. I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve (for I ſee no proof of it) any regenerating power in the water in Infants Baptiſme, much leſſe can I have reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſuch a converting power of grown perſons in the Lords Supper. He ſhall be alone for me that will appear in ſuch Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The command given, to take and eat of the bread, to drink of the cup, hath no ſuch power to convert. None can ſee the reaſon of the change of their wayes in any ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction; Converſion were an eaſie work in caſe this could do it.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, The Sacrament of the Lords Supper muſt by no means be parallelled with the Word, in the work of converſion; but the Word many wayes muſt have the preeminence: 1. The Word may work to converſion without the Lords Supper; There are many in ſaving grace, that did never partake of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:168215:117"/> Gods engagement by word and oath holds up the faith, and is the ground of ſtrong conſolation to thoſe that never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed this ſeal. But the Sacrament cannot convert or do any thing towards it, without the Word. A Covenant may convey an intereſt without a ſeal, when a ſeal can never do it without a Covenant. 2. The Sacrament does nothing of its own ſtrength, but by vertue from the Word; It hath its dependance on the Word for being, as a ſeal on a Covenant, and alſo for the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The Word may go alone in the work of converſion, yet may have aſſiſtance from the Sacrament; the Sacrament can never work alone without the Word, but as an aſſiſtant to it. 3. The Word muſt qualifie the ſoul for the Sacrament, in laying open the nature and uſe of it; and the ſoul muſt attend what the Sacrament holds out, otherwiſe there can be no improvement of it for any ſpiritual benefit: And theſe things being premiſed, I wonder how any that ſeem to appear moſt on the contrary part can juſtly be offended, that I affirm, (and as I think, with ſo good reaſon prove) that the Lords Supper may be aſſiſtant to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards converſion in ſome, and may work with the Word, to carry the ſoul profeſſing Chriſt up to it, eſpecially when it ſhall appear that I would have the door of admiſſion to ſtand at leaſt little more wide then they themſelves: And perhaps not ſo wide, as according to the practice of many of their judgment it ſtands already. Moſt of theſe acknowledge, that knowing perſons, free from groſſe errors and ſcandals, may be admitted; others ſay, none but they, that in the judgment of charity appear to be indeed in Chriſt, may be received; in which they yet confeſſe that men may be eaſily deceived: Either of theſe confeſſe, that many unconverted partake with them, even when rules of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion (according to their own mind) are moſt tenaciouſly held. And in caſe it appear that theſe may receive benefit by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and their converſion poſſibly holpen on, eſpecially if well followed on by the Word, why ſhould they be troubled? I confeſſe it is to me no ſmall trouble, to ſee godly Miniſters of the oppoſite way, ſo much enſnared in their own principles, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to let in ſuch (where moſt of order is held, and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline exerciſed) that of neceſſity further their damnation, and are in impoſſibility (according to their tenents) to improve it towards ſalvation.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, It is yet further objected, <hi>That in this doctrine we
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:168215:118"/> oppoſe the unanimous judgment of Proteſtant Divines, who gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally teach, that the Sacraments are appointed of God and delivered to the Church, as ſealing Ordinances, not to give, but to teſtifie what is given; not to make, but confirm Saints; ſimply denying the inſtrumentality of Sacraments, that they are appointed of God for working or giving grace where it is not. And that we concur with Papiſts, who hold that the Sacraments are inſtruments, to confer, give, or work, grace, ex opere operato.</hi> But how unjuſt this charge is, in both the parts of it, might eaſily be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">In this we Symbolize not with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.</note>Firſt, For that charge of joyning with the Papiſts, let any judge, who comes neareſt to their doctrine of the efficacy of this Sacrament. Not to mention the <hi>opus operatum,</hi> which is alike deteſted of both, (whatſoever is charged) but enquire fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what they deliver of the efficacy of it. <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> Part 3. quaeſt. 73. art. 3. putting differences between Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper, aſſignes this for one; <hi>Baptiſme is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of spiritual life, and the entrance of the Sacraments. The Euchariſt is the conſummation of ſpiritual life, and the end of all Sacraments.</hi> And further, <hi>The receiving of Baptiſme is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to begin ſpiritual life; The receiving of the Euchariſt is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the conſummation of it.</hi> The Councell of <hi>Florence,</hi> quoted by <hi>Suarez,</hi> diſput. 7. Quaeſt. 62. ſaith, <hi>By Baptiſme we are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually born again, and are nouriſhed by the Divine Alimony of the Euchariſt.</hi> Suarez, diſput. 63. Quaeſt. 79. laies down this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. <hi>This Sacrament is not inſtituted, per ſe to conferre the firſt grace;</hi> and confirmes it by multiplicity of Authors, and the <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches cuſtome, who never uſed to give the Sacrament unleſſe it be to thoſe whom ſhe believes to be cleanſed from ſin by Baptiſme or penance.</hi> And thus argues it by reaſon. <hi>The Sacrament</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doth not ſuppoſe the effect that it ſerves to work, but this Sacrament doth ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the man to be juſt that receives it.</hi> 2. <hi>Meat</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is not ordayned of it ſelf to quicken or raiſe the dead, but to nouriſh or ſtrengthen a man already alive. But this Sacrament is inſtituted, as meat and drink.</hi> And though he after affirmes that <hi>this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſometimes, and as by accident conferres the firſt grace,</hi> (which according to his principles he hath much a do to make out) <hi>yet he acknowledges that many and grave Divines held the contrary,</hi> quoting, <hi>Gabriel,</hi> Alenſis, <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> and <hi>Major.</hi> And their diſtinction is well enough known. That <hi>as a Sacrifice offered,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:168215:118"/> it takes away ſin; but as a Sacrament received, it onely nouriſhes, and increaſes ſpiritual life.</hi> By all which it appeares how farre thoſe of that part are from aſſent to this poſition; and no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, when they will hold their communicants in that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as to look after no more then conſecration, to inquire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing into the inſtitution. The way of the Sacraments work, as a viſible Word, as a demonſtrative ſign in the aggravation of ſin, and tender of pardon, is to them a myſtery.</p>
                        <p>As for the other part of the charge,<note place="margin">Nor oppoſe the unanimous judgement of Proteſtant Writers.</note> which <hi>is the oppoſition of the unanimous judgement of Proteſtant Authors;</hi> I know many are produced ſpeaking of the Sacraments, as no cauſes of ſpiritual life, or veſſels to convey it; but as ſeales and teſtimonies of Gods good will towards us. To which I fully ſubſcribe, as after ſhall (God willing) appear. But how farre moſt of them come ſhort when they are throughly examined, of that poſition which is laid down as their opinion, <hi>That they are appointed to ſeal unto a man that ſaving interest in Chriſt and the Covenant of grace that he hath already,</hi> may eaſily be demonſtrated. Firſt, That po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition hath that confuſion in it, that many of them will not own, and is inconſiſtent almoſt with all their principles. This makes intereſt in the Covenant of grace, and intereſt in Chriſt (which is underſtood of intereſt as a lively member) the ſame, when it is well known that they make Covenant-intereſt farre more large then intereſt in Chriſt; ſee Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> in his Vindication, pag. 48. quoting not alone <hi>Tertullian, Cyprian, Gregory, Nazianzen, Jerome, Auſtin,</hi> among the Ancient; but alſo <hi>Ameſius, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mier, Luther, Calvin, Beza, Pareus, Peter Martyr, Bucer, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanchton, Mr. Philpot,</hi> for this latitude of the Covenant. <hi>Pareus,</hi> (who is not looked upon as any diſſenting man from the reſt of his brethren) ſpeaks fully. When it was objected that all Iſrael was not in Covenant with God, nor all the infants of Chriſtians, becauſe ſome among them were, and are reprobates, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweres, <hi>To be in Covenant, or to have intereſt in it, is taken two waies, either according to the right of Covenant, or the benefit of it. He is in Covenant that either obtaines the benefits of the Covenant, which are pardon of ſin, Adoption, regeneration, ſalvation, or which hath onely the right or outward ſymbole of the Covenant.</hi> He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies his diſtinction that, <hi>that propoſition, That no reprobate is in Covenant with God, is onely true of the benefits of the Covenant, which heretofore were, and ſtill are peculiar to the Elect; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:168215:119"/> underſtood of the right, and outward ſymbole of the Covenant it is to be denyed; for that indifferently belongs to all that are born in the Church, among which many are reprobates, as the event doth demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate; neither is it lawful for the Church to exclude any, that by their own impiety do not exclude themſelves (which Iſraelites in times paſt did, and Apoſtatizing Chriſtians now do, to their greater damnation) whether they be of thoſe that by a true faith receive the benefits of the Covenant, or whether they be thoſe that remain hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.</hi> All of his practice muſt neceſſarily be of his judgement, unleſs we believe that their practice militates againſt their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. And that this is the practiſe of the reformed Churches in general, needs not to be ſhewn.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, They cannot then baptize any upon the account of Covenant-holineſſe, but onely holineſſe of regeneration. This is plain. If the right be theirs alone that have their intereſt as in Covenant, ſo alſo in Chriſt, onely theſe muſt be baptized, or elſe we muſt baptize without right. And that they do not onely baptize, but diſpute for Baptiſme upon a bare Covenant-intereſt without any further title is manifeſt.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly. This ſtands not with that which they hold concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the way of the Sacraments ſealing, which according to them can be no evidence that he does believe, as ſome aſſert, evidences of faith muſt be in the ſoul, and not in the Sacrament; neither doth it abſolutely make up to the ſoul the benefit of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, then no man without infallible revelation (ſuch as it ſeems <hi>Ananias</hi> had concerning <hi>Paul</hi>) could adminiſter it. It ſeals the benefits of the Covenant upon Gods terms and propoſitions, which when the ſoul makes good, there is Gods ſeal for perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. That this is the judgement of Proteſtant Divines, I have elſewhere declared, Treatiſe of the Covenant, pag. 35, 36. ſo that their Doctrine of the Sacraments doth not oppoſe the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition delivered.</p>
                        <p>Hitherto I have conſidered ſome generall charges againſt this poſition; now I muſt look into ſome Arguments in form produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Several parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note>Firſt, <hi>Sacraments,</hi> (ſay ſome) <hi>are ſignes, as appears in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition, and not cauſes of what they ſignifie; ſignes declaring and ſhewing that we have Faith in Chriſt, remiſſion of ſin by him and union with him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To let that ſlip paſſe, making them no cauſes, becauſe they are
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:168215:119"/> ſignes, as though no ſigne were a cauſe of the thing ſignified: This to me is as ſtrange as new, that Sacramental ſignes declare, and ſhew that we have faith and remiſſion of ſins. The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment now in queſtion, is a ſigne of the body and blood of Chriſt, in whom by faith remiſſion of ſins may be obtained I know; but that it is a ſigne either that we do believe, or that we have remiſſion of ſin otherwiſe then upon our believing, (to which this engages, but not preſuppoſes) I know not. <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> had not Baptiſme, to ſignifie that all his ſins were forgiven; but that by faith in the Name of Chriſt he might be forgiven. Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> ſayes well, Vindication, pag. 54. <hi>The initiatory ſeal, which holds true of the other ſeal, is not primarily and properly the ſeal of mans faith, or repentance, or obedience, but of Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant rather; the ſeal is to the Covenant: even</hi> Abrahams <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was not primarily a ſeal to</hi> Abrahams <hi>faith of righteouſneſſe, but to the righteouſneſſe of faith exhibited and effected in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; yea, to the Crvenant it ſelf or promiſe, which had believed unto righteouſneſſe: hence the Covenant of grace is called the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of faith,</hi> Rom. 10. I confeſſe it is a ſymbole of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith, but this is not the faith ſpoken to, neither is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins annext unto it.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>That which neceſſarily ſuppoſeth converſion and faith, doth not work converſion and faith: But the Sacrament of the Lords Supper ſuppoſeth converſion and faith.</hi> The Minor is proved, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.36, 37. ver. 41. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.4.7. All which texts are ſpoken of Baptiſme, and not of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. To that text, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16. I have ſpoken fully, Treatiſe of the Covenant, pag. 243. To that, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.36, 37. I have ſpoken pag. 244. To that of <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. I have ſpoken, pag. 396. and ther is no need that I ſhould repeat what I have ſaid. For <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. <hi>They that gladly received his Word, were baptized,</hi> It ſpeaks no more then ready acceptation of the tender of the Goſpel; and whether this neceſſarily implyes ſaving faith, let <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.20, 21. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.15. be conſulted. For, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.47. <hi>Can any man forbid water,</hi> that theſe ſhould not be baptized, who have received the holy Ghoſt as well as we? it proves that men of gifts from the Spirit have title, ſuch gifts gave <hi>Judas</hi> a title not onely to baptiſme, but Apoſtleſhip; ſuch a faith may be had, and ſanctification wanting.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>That which gives us new food, ſuppoſeth that we have
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:168215:120"/> the new birth, and Spiritul life; and that we are not ſtill dead in treſpaſſes and ſins: But the Sacrament of the Lords Supper gives us new food:</hi> Ergo.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Metaphors are ill materials to make up into ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmes.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. A difference may be put between ordinary food, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and quickening food: It may be true of the former, but not of the latter.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Word as well as the Sacrament gives us new food, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. and yet preſuppoſeth not new life. If any reply, that the Word is more then food; it is ſeed as well as food, and it gives not new life as food, but as ſeed. I anſwer that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is more then food. There is a Sacramental work prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our taking and eating, which ſome ſay may be done to edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and profit, by thoſe that are not admitted to be partakers; where they divide I may diſtinguiſh, and there Chriſt is ſet forth to the aggravation of ſin: to carry on the work of contrition and compunction.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>That Ordinance which is inſtituted onely for believers and juſtified perſons, is no converting, but a ſealing Ordinance: But this Sacrament is inſtituted onely for believers and juſtified perſons.</hi> The Minor is proved, <hi>Circumciſion was a ſeal of the righteouſneſſe of faith,</hi> Rom. 4.17. <hi>much more then Baptiſme; and if Baptiſme, much more the Lords Supper.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> Upon this account it muſt needs follow, that as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was a juſtified man, ſo <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was juſtified alſo, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the mind of God, and in obedience to his commands was circumciſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.23. yea, every Proſelyte that joyned himſelf to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and every male in <hi>Iſrael</hi> according to this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation muſt be juſtified. 2. Howſoever <hi>Abraham</hi> was a juſtified perſon, yet his Circumciſion in that place is not made a proof of his juſtification, but a diſtinct text of Scripture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.16. quoted by the Apoſtle, ver. 3. And that Scripture ſetting out his juſtification to be by faith, and not by works, the Apoſtles words onely ſhew that the Sacrament of Circumciſion ſealed the Covenant, not of works, but of faith; ſo that Mr. <hi>Cobbets</hi> words quoted in anſwer to the firſt argument, are a full anſwer here.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, <hi>The Apoſtle argues, that</hi> Abraham <hi>the Father of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and whoſe juſtification is a pattern of ours, was not juſtified by
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:168215:120"/> Circumciſion. Circumciſion was not the cauſe, but the ſign of his juſtification. Therefore no Sacrament is a cauſe of our juſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> Though animadverſions might be made on theſe words, yet if any will put them into form, I ſhall grant the concluſion, when I ſay the Sacrament, as an Appendix to the Word, may have its influence with the word upon a profeſſor offaith to work him to the truth of faith, I am far from ſaying it is any cauſe of juſtification; I look on faith no otherwiſe, then as an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the work, and the Sacrament as an help, and not the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal to the work of faith.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, There is an argument drawn from the neceſſity of examination which before hath received an anſwer.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, <hi>That Ordinance unto which none may come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a wedding garment, is no converting Ordinance: But the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord, the marriage feast of the Kings Son, is an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance unto which a man may not come without a wedding argument.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Arguments drawn from parables muſt be uſed with all tenderneſſe. But in this Argument here is much bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to make this Ordinance that marriage-feaſt. 2. We ſhall find if we look to the ſcope of it, that this feaſt is the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt in his Kingdom, as appears by thoſe words that give occaſion to the Parable of the Supper, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.15. <hi>And when one of them that ſate at meat with him, heard theſe things, he ſaid unto him, Bleſſed is he that ſhall eat bread in the kingdom of God.</hi> Now thoſe that pretend a forwardneſſe towards it and are not prepared and fitted for it, (according to the ſcope of the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) ſhall be caſt out from it. This therefore may fairly prove that none that appear in Ordinances, and yet remaine in their ſins, ſhall come to heaven; But it no more proves that a man cannot get ſaving good by this Ordinance, then it proves that a man cannot get ſaving good by the Word; The VVord may lay as fair a claime to this wedding feaſt, as the Lords Supper.</p>
                        <p>Eighthly, <hi>That Ordinance which is not appointed to work faith, is no converting Ordinance: But the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is not appointed to work faith; Ergo.</hi> The Aſſumption is proved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>Faith cometh by hearing, hearing by the Word of God; then not by ſeeing; if by the Word, then not by the Sacrament.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> If faith comes by hearing, will it therefore follow that hearing can receive no help from, but muſt exclude ſeeing?
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:168215:121"/> Did the <hi>Bereans</hi> when they had heard the Apoſtles, yet nothing towards faith by their ſearch of the Scriptures? <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11.12. or did they not make uſe of their eyes in the ſearch that they made? When Chriſt had Preached to the Jewes not yet in the faith, and commended to them the ſearch of the Scriptures, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.39. can we think that this ſearch could be no ſtep in their way of believing? Why were miracles wrought, if they were of no uſe to the work of faith f What comment ſhall we make on thoſe words, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.23. <hi>Many believed in his Name when they ſaw the miracles that were done?</hi> If the Word do work faith, it will by no means follow, but that it may take in aſſiſtance by miracles, and Sacraments, by ſignes extraordinary and ordinary. That conſequence, if by the Word, then not by the Sacrament, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hold, till the VVord and Sacrament are proved to be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, and not ſubordinate.</p>
                        <p>Ninthly, <hi>That Ordinance, which hath neither the promiſe of the grace of converſion annext unto it, or any example in the Word of God of any converted by it, is no converting Ordinance: But the Sacrament of the Lords Supper hath no ſuch promiſe of the grace of converſion, neither is there ſuch an example:</hi> Ergo.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> For Examples, though we could give inſtances of men being converted by receiving of the Lords Supper, yet it would ſtill be denyed to have any poſſible influence towards conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; as the laſt Argument is an evident witneſſe. We bring Examples of men that have been brought to the faith by ſeeing, and yet it is ſtill denyed that fight can be any help towards it. And though we could bring a promiſe of ſuch grace annext, yet we ſhould have little hopes to be heard or heeded, ſeeing we can bring a Promiſe of bleſſedneſſe to reading, which is by ſight, as to hearing, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. <hi>Bleſſed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this Prophecy.</hi> 2. We have as many examples of mens converſion by the Sacrament, as we have of their recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtrength and nouriſhment: If one may be aſſerted without an example, then then other likewiſe. 3. We have no particular precedents by name (except at firſt inſtitution) of any that were Communicants, and therefore we cannot expect examples of converſion, or receiving of ſtrength by communicating. 4. The examples of converſion by the Word perhaps well examined, would prove ſhort of ſuch converſion as here is intended. The converſion in Goſpel narratives is to a Chriſtian profeſſion. A
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:168215:121"/> man may evince calling thence, but not elctdion, and this is the work of the Word without the Sacrament, ſeeing it muſt precede the receiving of the Sacrament.</p>
                        <p>As to that of no promiſe made to it, 1. When the adverſary ſhall bring a promiſe made to the Sacrament for Spiritual ſtrength, it will happily be found of an equal force to the giving of a new life. 2. Though we have no promiſe explicite, and expreſſe; yet we have promiſes implicite and virtual. Every promiſe made to the Word is made to the Sacrament; The Sacrament being not oppoſite, but ſubordinate to it, an appendant that receives ſtrength from it.</p>
                        <p>Tenthly, <hi>That Ordinance whereof Chriſt would have no unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy perſon to partake, is not a converting Ordinance. But the Lords Supper is an Ordinance whereof Chriſt would have no unworthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to partake:</hi> Ergo. <hi>The Minor is proved,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.27.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Argument well followed will take off every Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance from that honour of converſion, as well as this of the Lords Supper: ſeeing many Texts may be produced, equally calling for qualifications for them as for this, equally ſhewing the danger of unworthy addreſſes. As to this for hearing the Word, ſee 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>Wherefore laying aſide all malice, and all guile, and hypocriſies, and envies, and all evill ſpeakings, as new-burn babes deſire the ſincere milk, of the Word, that ye may grow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</hi> Jam. 1.21. <hi>Wherefore lay apart all filthineſſe and ſuperfluity of naughtineſſe, and receive with meekneſſe the engraffed Word, which is able to ſave your ſoules.</hi> Is not the Word a favour of death unto death to ſuch? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14, 15, 16. Shall i. not be more tolerable for <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Zidon</hi> then for them? <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.24. For prayer to God, ſee <hi>James</hi> 1.6, 7. <hi>But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering; for he that wavereth is like a wave of the Sea, driven with the wind, and toſſed; for let not that man think:; he ſhall receive any thing of the Lord,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.8. <hi>I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting: Good will never be had by ſuch mens prayers.</hi> Eſay 1.15. <hi>And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you when ye make many prayers, I will not hear, your hands are full of blood.</hi> Zach. 7.13. <hi>Therefore it is come to paſſe, that he cryed, and they would not hear: ſo they cryed, and I would not hear, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Shall we now ſay, that neither Word, nor prayer is a converting Ordinance? But perhaps it
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:168215:122"/> will be ſaid, <hi>Men unworthy muſt hear, muſt pray to be made wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, muſt come in unconverſion to be converted. But they muſt bring worthineſſe hither, or elſe this can have no hand in making worthy they muſt bring converſion, or elſe this cannot convert.</hi> This is a begging of the queſtion. And as to prayer, there is no more ground, or colour to make it a converting Ordinance, then the Supper; we muſt pray in faith, before we can pray, with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of our perſons, and ſo muſt the Word be <hi>mixt with faith when we hear it,</hi> Heb. 4.2.</p>
                        <p>Eleventhly, <hi>That Ordinance which is euchariſticall and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolatory, ſuppoſeth ſuch that partake of it to have part and portion in that thing for which thanks is given, and are ſuch as are fit to be comforted: But the Lords Supper is an Ordinance euchariſticall and conſolatory:</hi> Ergo.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> And might not the Aſſumption. as well have been, That the Word and Prayer are Ordinances euchariſtical, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolatory? I hope none will deny the Goſpel (our good tydings) to be euchariſtical, and conſolatory; nor yet thankſgiving which is a branch of prayer. And then in caſe the Propoſition be of univerſal truth, both Word, Prayer, and Lords Supper, are excluded from any power of converſion; The Propoſition then muſt be underſtood with limit, and reſtriction; That Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, which in whole and in part is euchariſtical and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory, can have no hand in converſion, and then (though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps exception might be taken at it) it had colour in it: But then the Aſſumption, That <hi>this Ordinance is in whole and in part euchariſticall and conſolatory,</hi> muſt be denyed. It is for humbling, heart-breaking, as it is comforting: There we ſhew forth Chriſts death, and ſee him broken for ſin; and it is no matter of conſolation, but humiliation and horrour to ſee our ſoules un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that guilt that brought upon Chriſt a neceſſity to ſuffer; Though it is a matter of conſolation, that guilt by ſuffering is removed, and an atonement made, in which there is either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent aſſurance, or at leaſt a poſſibility of future actuall inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.</p>
                        <p>Twelfthly, <hi>That Ordiinance, unto which Chriſt calleth none but ſuch that have ſpiritual gracious qualifications, is not a converting, but a ſealing Ordinance: But the Lords Supper is an Ordinance unto which Chriſt calleth none but ſuch as have spiritual and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious qualifications;</hi> Ergo. The Aſſumption is proved, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:168215:122"/> 28. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.37. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.1.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> Onely one of theſe ſpeaks of the Lords Supper, the reſt have immediate relation to Chriſt, not to this Ordinance, of the Supper and poſitive ſpiritual qualifications, as preceding all coming, is not required in any of them; upon ſenſe of want, we may come to Chriſt for ſpiritual qualifications; (as wen may come with them) though without poſitive ſpiritual qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there is no aſſurance of intereſt in him. 2. As to that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe which is ſpoken to, in that Text of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> there is an uſual diſtinction of worthineſſe of <hi>merit,</hi> and worthineſſe <hi>ſuitable to the work in hand;</hi> It is the latter onely, that, as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, is called for. There is yet a double ſuitableneſſe to the work: One is compleat, anſwering to all that the work can call for, which compriſes grace, not onely in the habit, but in the act; an actual improvement of our graces for the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; and this is alike required in other Ordinances of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, praying, &amp;c. as in this Orainance of communicating. The other is a worthineſſe, reſpecting the perſon that doth commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate: ſuch a worthineſſe of ſuitableneſſe and conveniency, whereby according to the meaſure of grace vouchſafed (whether common; or ſaving) he addreſſeth himſelf to it. Now though the regenerate man alone receives to the acceptation of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as he onely hears and prayes with ſuch acceptance: yet a man in unregeneration may be ſo far ſuitably worthy for this work, that he may know himſelf called untp it, and that it would be his ſin to hold back from it: and he may hopeuMlly expect bleſſing in it: and ſuch a worthineſſe was in Chriſts and <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> hearers, ſo many of them as have their commendations in the Goſpel for ſuch ready and forward hearing; and ſuch a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, as I take it, is mentioned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10 11. Let the Learned Conſider, whether either the word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>indigne,</hi> or the context in that place will neceſſarily take in every unregenerate man, or rather the irreverend prOphanation of that duty; and whether arguments drawn from want of ſaving faith, and ſincere repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in performance of this work, do not bring unregenerate men under like danger in faſting, praying, thankſgiving, hearing, Sabbath-keeping, and every other duty of worſhip whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                        <p>Thirteently, <hi>That Ordinance which is inſtituted for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:168215:123"/> of Saints, is intended onely for ſuch as are Saints, and not for unconverted ſinners: But the Lords Supper is an Ordinance inſtituted for the Communion of Saints, and thoſe that are members of the ſame body of Chriſt. The aſſumption proved,</hi> 1 Cor. 1016, 17. <hi>compared with</hi> 1 Cor. 1.2.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> Saint, is either ſuch that are ſo by calling and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for God, or elſe by qualifications and regeneration from God. In the former ſenſe, unconverted ſinners, proſeſſing the Goſpel, are Saints: as of old they were of the people of God, and called by his Name: Saint is a New Teſtament-word, taking in all of a Chriſtian profeſſion, and outward Covenant-intereſt, and then the Propoſition is to be denyed; Saint being taken in the latter ſenſe, the aſſumption is falſe. This Lords Supper is a priviledge of the Church as viſible, diſpenſed by viſible officers, not as inviſible, as thoſe very Texts quoted do manifeſt.</p>
                        <p>Fourteenthly, <hi>If Baptiſme it ſelf (at leaſt when adminiſtred to thoſe that are of age) is not a regenerating or converting Ordinance, far leſſe is the Lords Supper a regenerating or converting Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: But Baptiſme it ſelf (at leaſt when miniſtred to thoſe that are of age) is not a regenerating or converting Ordinance:</hi> Ergo.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Argument ſeemeth to ſuppoſe an opinion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation or converſion, by the very work done in Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper; which ſeeing I do not own, but in either of both diſclaim, I need to give no further anſwer.</p>
                        <p>Fifteenthly, <hi>If the Baptiſme even of thoſe that are at age muſt neceſſarily precede the receiving of the Lords Supper, then the Lords Supper is not a converting, but a ſealing Ordinance: But Baptiſme even of thoſe that are of age muſt neceſſarily precede the Lords Supper:</hi> Ergo.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſee no neceſſity of this conſequence, unleſſe I ſhould believe that all that are baptized, are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> regenerate; and that not with an initial regeneration (of which ſome ſpeak) that may be loſt, but the immortal ſeed of the Spirit that abides for ever; But being not (as I am not) of that faith, I ſuppoſe a baptized man may be (to uſe <hi>Pareus</hi> his phraſe) <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianus non regeneratus, ſed regenerandus,</hi> a Chriſtian not regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, but to be regenerate: and ſo regeneration may, as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily it doth, not precede, but follow Baptiſme.</p>
                        <p>Sixteenthly, There is an Argument drawn from the Parable
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:168215:123"/> of the Prodigal, <hi>There is a robe ring, and ſhoes put upon him, and a fatted calf killed for him, but this when he comes to himſelf, and ſayes, Father, I have ſinned, &amp;c. But this is done in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper more eſpecially, and manifeſtly then in any other Ordinace:</hi> Ergo.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> All Ordinances (as I take it) are to bring a prodigal unto ſuch a returning poſture, in the diſcovery of the hateful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſin againſt ſuch a Father, and the riches that are in his Fathers family. There are ſome Arguments of this nature fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, which may ſeaſonably be ſpoke to in the cloſe of theſe Propoſitions. I ſhall onely here by the way, hint ſo much to the Reader, that in caſe theſe Arguments had been framed againſt the power of this Sacrament, for converſion the ſenſe as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the oppoſers of it underſtand it, that it works, as a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine to heal, and hath an <hi>opus operatum</hi> in it: I ſhould not at all have undertaken them, how inconcluding ſoever I had judged them: But ſeeing a tendency in them, to intereſt alone, men already in grace in this Ordinance, and denying all hope of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by it, to the majority of thoſe that men, of all intereſts ordinarily admit to it, to the neceſſary enſnaring of all that are concerned in the adminiſtration of it, I could not be ſilent; let the Reader impartially weigh and determine.</p>

                        <p>Firſt, Thoſe that by reaſon of minority and non-age are not yet ripe for the uſe of reaſon, as Infants, and young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</p>

                        <p>Fourthly, Thoſe that by their groſſe neglect in ſpiritual things, never made improvement of it.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>Infants,</hi> Theſe the Church, as well Popiſh, as reformed by an univerſall received cuſtome denies to admit; As the Diſciples ſometimes rebuked thoſe that brought infants to Chriſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a bleſſing: ſo the Church now provides, that none ſhall bring them to partake of this Sacrament. And though the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſuffered a check from our Saviours mouth in the one. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants having title to, and being in a capacity to receive bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by that Church-priviledg, as being Church-member: yet we believe the Church is free from reproof in the other, upon the ground laid down before, <hi>viz.</hi> their incapacity to improve it to their ſpiritual benefit. It is true that the practice in the Church for at leaſt ſome Churches) anciently was otherwiſe: as thoſe know, that are verſt in antiquity; ſeveral quotations out of <hi>Dionyſius Areo pagita, Cyprian, Auſtin, the Councell of Tolet,</hi> may be ſeen in <hi>Suarez,</hi> diſput. 62. quaeſt. 79. Art. 8. ſect. 4. Though according to <hi>Thomas Aquinas Dionyſius</hi> his words make not for it, as may be ſeen, part. 3. quaeſt. 80. Art. 9. This cuſtome <hi>Maldonate</hi> in <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.53. ſaith continued in the Church, 600. years, but he onely ſaith it; and <hi>Suarez</hi> in the place before quoted ſaies, it was never received of the whole Church, and perhaps (ſaith he) the practice was not Common, ſeeing there is no more mention of it among the Ancient; and quotes the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:168215:124"/> of ſome, that day, <hi>The Fathers never obſerved this cuſtome, but onely tolerated it, becauſe they could not reſiſt the multitude.</hi> And one that ſpeaks enough in favour of it, findes the practice of it in <hi>Africk,</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> but can bring no teſtimony out of <hi>Aſia</hi> for it; onely he ſaies, that he does not read, that the cuſtome was contrary in any part of <hi>Aſia.</hi> The Schooles have diſputed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants capacity of it; <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> in the place quoted, is againſt it, together with many others, whoſe names <hi>Suarez</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Suarez</hi> himſelf is for the affirmative, that infants are in capacity of it, as that which (he ſaith) is farre the more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and hath moſt reaſon and authority for it. And in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion hath much ado to excuſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of it, as <hi>Janſenius</hi> hath for their Communion onely in one kind, <hi>Harmon. Evang.</hi> cap. 131. when the practice of all antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he confeſſes was otherwiſe; and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> for their eating on faſt daies before the evenning againſt all Scripture precedent, <hi>Bellar, de bon. oper.</hi> lib. 2. cap. 2. But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf hath reformed this, and hath not put our Reformers to the trouble of it, though a man might wonder what moved them to it, giving ſo much to this Sacrament as they do, to conferre grace by the work done, and to fortifie the foul againſt Satan. But it is plain, that the high reverence they gave to their tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiated elements, moved them to it, leſt any thing unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of them ſhould befal them; upon the ſame account that they deny their cup to their laity, they deny the bread to thoſe that are in minority, ſee <hi>Janſenius ut ſupra:</hi> an eminent Writer of the Proteſtants appears much in favour of this practice, not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the reaſons that moved thoſe Fathers, (which was a ſuppoſed neceſſity of it grounded on thoſe words of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.53. <hi>Except ye eat the fleſh of the Sonne of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you,</hi> underſtanding it of Sacramentall eating at the Lords Table) but on other grounds, 1. Thoſe that are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the thing ſignified, are not to be denied the ſign. 2. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are of the Church, they ſerve to make up that body, and Chriſt the Saviour of the body. 3. Chriſt himſelf ſaith. <hi>Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of ſuch is the Kingdome of heaven.</hi> And from each of theſe he drawes up formal Arguments for infants admittance. And he ſuppoſeth that that text which is brought as a barre to hold them back, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:168215:125"/> that bread, and drink of that cup,</hi> may be eaſily anſwered, that it is to be underſtood of thoſe onely that are in danger to eat and drink unworthily, and ſo to be guilty of the body and blood of Chriſt, of which (ſaith he) there is no fear of infants. Theſe Arguments undoubtedly are of ſtrength to conclude their fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental right and title, as to baptiſme, ſo to the Lords Supper, but they are two weak, to give them actual admiſſion; They conclude their <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> but not their <hi>jus in re;</hi> They have upon theſe grounds a firſt right, but they muſt wait a further growth till they have a ſecond. Baptiſme gives right in the face of the Church to all Chriſtian priviledges, and this is a Chriſtian priviledg; ſo alſo the hearing of the Myſteries of Faith, the higheſt of Myſteries, to be taken into debate of doubts, of the higheſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are Chriſtian-priviledges, yet as every baptized perſon hath not forthwith theſe high Myſteries communicated to him, nor yet is admitted to ſuch high debates, as Chriſt was at the age of 12. years which is recorded as a miracle: ſo neither are they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be actually admitted to the Lords Table. And if that text of preexamination may be avoided, yet ſufficient may be ſaid for a barre to their admiſſion. They cannot do that which is outwardly to be done at this Table, they cannot take and eat; ſee <hi>Whitaker,</hi> pag. 373. And in caſe the bread be put into their mouthes, it is more like to be caſt out then eaten. They cannot anſwer the end of the Sacrament, to do it in remembrance of Chriſt, or to ſhew forth the Lords death in that ordinance; And ſo no poſſible benefit can be conceived in reaſon to come to them by it. In baptiſme it is otherwiſe, there is nothing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be done by him that is baptized. It is ſufficient to be paſſive, there is advantage by it, the perſon (whether infant or of age) is enrolled into the ſociety of the people of God, is a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the body of Chriſt, viſible, myſtical: and upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count intereſſed in the prayers and bleſſings of the Church: is enrighted, and upon that account, as growth makes fit, to be admitted to other priviledges, and aſſoon as of any diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to diſcern, they know to what ſocietie they do belong, and accordingly to applie themſelves; And therefore infants have a bare fundamental right to the Lords Table, but actual admiſſion to Baptiſme. And where as it is objected, that infants had not onely right to the Paſſeover, but were alſo actually admitted to it, they had not onely their <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> but their <hi>jus in re,</hi> and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:168215:125"/> conſequently infants have like right to the Lords Supper: To this I anſwer, 1. That infants properly ſo called, did not eat of the Paſſeover, being by reaſon of infancie in an incapacitie, for ſuch ſolid meats, as <hi>Rivet</hi> obſerves. 2. It no where appears, that infants did partake otherwiſe then as they were involved in the houſhould. There is no Ordinance requiring infants to repair to the place that God choſe for it; <hi>It is for thoſe males</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ainſworth) which were free-men perfect, males in health, able to go up to the place of publick worſhip: quoting withal the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies Authority, That all men are bound, except the deaf and the dumbe, and the fool, and the little child, and the blind, and the lame, and the uncircumciſed, and the old men, and the ſick and the tender, and the weak that were not able to go on their feet.</hi> When we read of the pains that they took to go up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> on theſe occaſions, through the valley of <hi>Baca,</hi> Pſal. 84.6. we hear nothing of their pains to carry along their infants, which muſt have been their care if by Divine appointment the Paſchal Lamb as a Sacrament had been ordained for infants. 3. The Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over as Manna, and the Rock is conſidered two waies. 1. As common food, and means of preſent livelihood and ſubſiſtance. 2. As viſible pledges of Gods abode among them, and protect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>For thoſe that never made improvement of their reaſon in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals, but being men of years, are ſtill children in knowledge, they have their title or fundamental right,<note place="margin">Groſly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ones a re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in an incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</note> (as I ſaid before of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants) but they are no more meet for this Ordinance then infants; ſuch I mean, that <hi>for the time might be teachers, and yet have need to be taught which be the firſt principles of the Oracles of God.</hi> If I ſhould demand, why boyes and girles as ſoon as they can eat of the Bread, and drink of the Cup, be not received to this Supper; but all in non-age by general conſent exempted, and therefore none offer themſelves? No reaſon (to me imaginable) can be given, but their inability of improvement of it to their Spiritual advantage; years of diſcretion are expected, and then they are to be admitted: and this is generally acknowledged to ſtand with reaſon, And what reaſon is there that without any diſcretion they ſhould be admitted at the uſual year of diſcretion? At one and twenty years men arrive at the age to enter upon their poſſeſſions: yet when it may appear that at theſe years they have not abilities to manage it for their benefit, the Law hath provided that they ſhall not be intruſted with it. The igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance before mentioned in the ſeveral kinds was <hi>ignorantia purae negationis,</hi> They underſtand not, becauſe God hath denyed them underſtanding: It is their defect or affliction, but it is not their ſin; this that we now mention, is <hi>ignorantia pravae diſpoſitionis,</hi> a withſtanding of the light that is tendered and offered. All of theſe are in an equal incapacitie of benefit by the Sacrament: but theſe laſt in a ſinful incapacitie. And when the former, whoſe ignorance is not their ſin, are confeſt to be uncapable, I do not ſee how ſin can put the latter into a better capacitie of it. When a Covenant was entered in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Nehem. 9.10. all ſorts and ſexes <hi>having knowledge and underſtanding entered,</hi> Nehem. 10.28. If any had ſworn to the articles, and had not at all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood them, ſuch an oath would have done no ſervice; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was provided, that onely they that underſtood, ſubſcribed, and ſealed. They that receive this ſeal, and conſequently put to
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:168215:126"/> their ſeal, when they know not the articles of it, or any uſe of theſe Sacramental ſignes, they ſee not themſelves at all obliged, when the Covenant of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was to be ſealed underſtandingly, the Covenant of the Goſpel is not to be ſealed ignorantly: A book in the hand of the unlearned that cannot read, is of as much uſe as this Sacrament to him that doth not underſtand. It is to theſe, as the painted frontiſpices that we ſee in many books, without any key to open them; they be full of myſteries, but the ignorant beholder ſees nothing but an outſide. He may gaze an hour together, and be as wiſe as before. Such an one ſees bread and wine, but what they mean, he knowes nothing, nor any proportion between ſign and thing ſignified, or what the Miniſters tender, or his own receiving ſpeaks to him. Theſe may (perhaps) have ſome blind devotion towards this Sacrament (which Popiſh Schoolmen judge ſufficient, if not obſtructed with mortal ſin) by reaſon of the Churches cuſtome to receive it, and ſome high opinion of ſome hidden and unknown vertue in it, but it is not the leaſt account that they can give of any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of it, as a reaſon of their devotion towards it, being ſcarce able to produce any command for it, not knowing either the author, time, or end of the inſtitution of it; much leſſe are they able to underſtand any need their ſoules have of it. When the <hi>Corinthians</hi> came unworthily to the Lords Table, all is laid upon this, that <hi>they diſcerned not the Lords body:</hi> I do not think that this is alone the ignorant mans ſin: All are in their meaſure guilty that do not conſiderately obſerve the glory of that Ordinance, and of Chriſt in it. A man of rude behaviour, in a great Perſonages preſence, is told that he knowes not where he is, or to whom he ſpeaks, when he well enough knowes, and needs no information; but doth not conſider his diſtance: but I ſay there is a neceſſity of that guilt in all that are ignorant. All do not conſider as they ought, that know; but none that does not know, can conſider. This is to be done in remembrance of Chriſt, which contains in it a calling into our thoughts all the work of his ſacrificing himſelf for ſin, which is never done by the man that knowes not ſin, that knowes not the Law, which is tranſgreſt by ſin; that neither knowes the nature of ſin, nor the guilt of attending it; that hath not any poſſible experimental ſenſe of the danger of it, and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines ignorant of Chriſt that redeems from it; being able to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:168215:127"/> give no account why the blood of Chriſt, rather then the blood of any other ſhould take away ſin; or how this death hath any ſuch ſatisfying temitting vertue, as to anſwer the Juſtice of God, or merit his Grace; neither knowing the Perſon of Chriſt in his humanity, or Deity, nor able to give account which Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Trinity took our nature, and gave himſelf a ranſom: perhaps they will ſay that Chriſt was God, and Man; and as ready to ſay that the Father, the Holy Ghoſt, were God and man in like ſort: knowing as little or leſſe of his offices, what he does as a King, or what he does as a Prieſt, or what he does as a Prophet, for his Church. If you look on the Sacrament as a ſpiritual medicine, they never knew their ſoules ſickneſſe, nor ever underſtood any healing vertue in it. If you look upon it as ſpiritual food, for the ſtrengthning of graces, they never knew what hunger was, or any ſtrengthning vertue that here can be found: look upon it as a ſpiritual cordial, and they never had ſenſe of ſin to any ſwooning fit, nor yet knew any reſtaurative vertue to be found in it: look upon it as an heart-breaking, ſoul-melting Ordinance, as the Law never diſcovered to them the danger of ſin, ſo they ſee nothing here held out for the aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſin. They ſee what in courſe the Miniſter does, and what the Communicants do; But any end, or reaſon why he, or they do it, they know nothing. If the Word which is added to the element to make up a Sacrament, were a bare Word of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, to be muttered over the elements for their change, ſo that the bare participation would ſerve turn, (as Phyſick works without any regard of the Patients knowledge or ignorance) it were ſomewhat. But the Sacrament (as hath been ſaid) is a ſeal appendant to the Covenant of God, and there is no improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, other wiſe then as the Covenant and the Promiſe is improved, (which muſt be known before it can be believed and applyed) ignorance is a neceſſary barre to all benefit by it. Though I account it the weakeſt thing in the world, to make ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of this nature in the parent, any juſt ground of non-admiſſion of the Infant to Baptiſme. There is no neceſſity to conclude, that the child (who is born, and to be bred, in a vally of viſions, and intereſted in Ordinances able to ſave the ſoul,) ſhould unavoidably be ever held with Parents in blindneſſe; yet I can Judge no otherwiſe, but that it is a juſt barre to the parents, when it is enough for the Infant to be paſſive, in his firſt admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:168215:127"/> the parent muſt act and make uſe of his light, for further growth and confirmation. Some (I know) have ſaid, <hi>Who can tell but the perſon deemed to be ignorant, and heretofore ſuch indeed, yet making addreſſe to the Lords Table, and there hearing that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery laid open, and the uſe of thoſe elements unfolded, and cleared, may in that very time receive competent inſtruction, and be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a capacity for this Ordinance knowingly to partake of it.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no there be any abſolute poſſibility in this, I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. I am ſure there is little moral probability, or poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, that a man that hath lived under Ordinances 20, 30, 40, 50, perhaps more years, and all of this time hath been confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly ignorant; and upon that account, in an incapacity of this Sacrament for his profit: that now at this time, in a few minutes he ſhould grow ſuch a proficient as to fit himſelf for it; And in caſe any ſuch thing, if not by miracle, yet, to wonder and amazement, ſhould happen, it will be little loſſe for ſuch a one, to delay his actual participation for once, that he may give an account of his profiting, and upon a further progreſſe in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge have admittance the next time with greater ſatisfaction. If any do deſire to know the <hi>minimum quod ſic,</hi> where is the loweſt pitch of knowledge, that will put a man into a capacity of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of this Ordinance to his advantage? this of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty muſt be leſt to miniſterial Chriſtian prudence, in which there muſt be much of care and tenderneſſe, not to make blear-eyed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, blindneſſe, nor a dim-light midnight darkneſſe, where the wretchedneſſe of ſin is known, and Chriſt (who is our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy) ſo underſtood, that account can be given of his perſon, and that there is no other name under heaven by which we can be ſaved, and the Sacrament ſo underſtood, as that Chriſt crucified is there held but under thoſe elements, and tendred to believers: I durſt not paſſe a vote to have ſuch a one excluded let this be got out of them, in language of any kind, ſuch that we may diſcern that they know it, though they can ſcarce expreſſe it: in which alſo many circumſtances ſhould be prudently weighed, as the natural ingeny of the party, if ripe in other things, it is an evidence of affected ignorance, to be havy and dull here: The means that they have enjoyed for help in their knowledge, the longer at School, the better the Maſter, the more inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the truant: The growth of years that he had upon him, when he firſt manifeſted a care to know, age is unteachable in
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:168215:128"/> compariſon, of youth, a low meaſure of light ſometimes drawes on more ſtrength of affections; But where ſin is not ſeen, nor Chriſt known, and conſequently the ſoul is ſo in the dark, that no uſe can be made of this ordinance, for ſpiritual advantage, the perſon may juſtly be judged to be in a preſent incapacity. In which for the moſt part, it will be more ſafe to delay, then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to perſwade the party to forbear a little time: and in the mean while to commend meanes of further growth, by all means to endeavour his help, that he may be fairly drawn on, and not driven back from this Supper.</p>
                        <p>In the next place, thoſe that reſolvedly will not make im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of this Supper, but wilfully put a barre to their benefiting by it, are to be taken into conſideration. And his is done,</p>

                        <p>Now, either of both theſe (to ſpeake a few words of them joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) are either ſuch that are ſo in private and ſecret, or elſe openly and profeſſedly. Thoſe that are indeed ſuch, though in way moſt ſecret, in the preſent poſture as they ſtand, are in an equall incapacitie to make inprovement of this ordinance, with him that moſt openly proclaimes it; <hi>Judas</hi> was unfit when he did communicate, as well as <hi>Barabbas,</hi> if he had communicated.

Thoſe that are under the Churches cenſure upon account of that ſentence, muſt be deemed in an incapacity, when the ſentence, whether for error or for ſcandal, hath had its due work for reformation (as upon the inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian</hi>) it muſt be ſuppoſed that the Church will again reſtore them to their freedome: in the mean ſpace, whether the Church hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded right or wrong, be over rigid or juſt in her cenſure, it is not in any one ſingle Miniſter to determine. There is a famous ſtory related by Mr. <hi>Hooker.</hi> in His Eccleſiaſtical Policy, of one <hi>Bertelius,</hi> that was excommunicated by the ſentence of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and had procured from the Senate of the place, by common conſent, under their ſeal, a relaxation, further decree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (with ſtrange abſurdity, as the Author cenſures it) that it ſhould belong to the ſame Senate, to give final judgement in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of excommunication, and to abſolve whom it pleaſed them. <hi>Calvin</hi> hearing the report of it, ſaid, <hi>Before this decree ſhall take place, either my blood or baniſhment ſhall ſign it.</hi> And two daies before the Sacrament, <hi>kill me if ever this hand ſhall reach forth that which is holy, to them whom the Church hath judged deſpiſers.</hi> Men under publique ſentence muſt be deemed to be ſuch, as by ſentence they are adjudged.

                        <p>As for errors in judgement, they may be either immediately againſt theſe Sacramental ordinances or againſt Chriſt the ſumme and ſubſtance of them, and all Goſpel promiſes in Chriſt. Errors of the firſt kind are, 1. Theirs that are above ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, either upon pretence of the Spirits immediate work, without any agent or inſtrument on earth, ſo that there needs not, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Word, prayer, or Sacraments, the opinion of <hi>Swenkfeldius;</hi> or elſe becauſe all is grown corrupt, ſince the Apoſtles times, that a company cannot be found with whom they may communicate, as <hi>Muſculus</hi> ſpeakes of one in his Common places, that had not received the Sacrament of the Lords Supper of twelve eares, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could find no pure Church in which to obſerve it. I fear ſhortly we ſhall have many ſuch; But we need not here trouble our ſelves with theſe, ſeeing of their own accord, they keep at a diſtance from us. 2. Theirs that look upon the Sacraments as matters either antiquate and obſolete, as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Churches infancy, in which it was indulged, thoſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal obſervances, too low (as they think) for grown Chriſtians; or elſe as things of meer indifferency, which may be uſed or neglected; ſuch are unmeet to be received. If any ſuch be detected, ſeeing though the ſubſtance of religion be not in the Sacrament ſo much as in the Covenant, yet a man of ſo low an opinion of this ordinance, of neceſſity debarres himſelf of any benefit of it. a diffident opinion of a medicine, or conceit againſt it, is ſaid to hinder the working; I am ſure it will obſtruct the working of the Sacraments, which have no innate phyſical vertue, nor any other efficacy further then our underſtanding, and faith makes improvement. For errors againſt Chriſt, the ſumme and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Sacraments, as every error is ſome way againſt him who is the foundation and carries on the whole work of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) that which I have delivered, Treatiſe of the Covenant, pag. 232. (where I made it my buſineſſe, to give rules concerning ſeparation, when we are to ſtay with a Church, and
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:168215:129"/> when to leave it) may here be taken into conſideration, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both the kind and degree of theſe errors, and the place that they have got in the affections and reſolutions. Thoſe errors that neceſſitate us to leave a Church, when it is in the whole face of it tainted and polluted; may juſtly give occaſion to deny a member acceſſe, in caſe he tender himſelf to this ordinance. Theſe (as hath been ſaid) are either ſuch that render Chriſt in an uncapacity to be our Mediator and Saviour, or ſuch that are inconſiſtent in whole or in part with his Mediatourſhip; of the former kind are thoſe that are againſt his perſon. 1. Thoſe that impugne the Godhead of Chriſt, ſuch that though they give him the glory to be above Angels, yet will have him to be no more then a creature, a God in title and place, as are Magiſtrates, not in nature or power; an opinion that involves the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church, and all Churches in ſucceſſion, in Idolatry; giving the honour of God, the worſhip due to God, unto him who by nature is no God; a doctrine that will make Chriſt an impotent, and not an omnipotent head, too weak for his work, to governe the world, to bring under his enemies. 2. Thoſe that deny his manhood, as having not taken our fleſh, and ſo no ſuitable head, but a phantaſtique, or ſeeming body. Thoſe that are againſt his Mediatorſhip, are either ſuch that obſcure, or ſome way eclipſe it, (as every error doth that is any way conſiderable) or ſuch that raſe, if not utterly overthrow it, in ſome of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary parts of it, his Kingdome, Prieſthood or Prophetical of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Theſe are overthrown either directly, in termes of full oppoſition, or elſe by conſequence; and this either is immediate and evident, (the truth being confeſt, they cannot be denyed) or elſe the conſequence more remote, and not ſo eaſily diſcerned. Theſe things being premiſed, we muſt bring it home to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. 1. Where fundamental truths are not onely queſtioned, doubted, and diſputed; but abjured and denyed, errors directly,<note place="margin">Errors direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the foundation, or by clear conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental truths, tender the pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:168215:130"/> all the body by joynts and hands, having nouriſhment miniſtred and knit together, increaſeth with the increaſe of God:</hi> and how can they then find any ſpiritual nouriſhment? When they thus with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from Chriſt, they are juſtly denyed to ſit at his Table. But when the error is of an inferiour nature, as neither rendring Chriſt in an incapacity to be a Saviour, nor yet wholly inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the work of his Mediatorſhip; or at leaſt, not ſuch directly, but only by way of conſequence; and that not immediate and evident, but more obſcure, and remote: ſo that it may juſtly be hoped, that in caſe the conſequence were ſeen, the concluſion that they draw would be beſt, rather then the principle of truth denyed, the caſe is then otherwiſe. As we might live in ſuch a Church, in caſe doctrine of that kind were received and taught; ſo we may not refuſe ſuch a member, making his farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, our buſineſſe; where ignorance may ſtand with grace, there errour is not wholly inconſiſtent with it: And where there is any fair poſſibility that Chriſt may be, there this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is not to be denyed. And in caſe the opinion entertained, and contended for, be yet more ſoul, ſo that we have juſt cauſe, as the Apoſtle of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> to ſay, that their doctrine is inconſiſtent with grace; yet being not (as we can diſcern) fixedly ſettled, and reſolutely received, and concluded upon; but with heſitancy and wavering, their faith rather ſtaggered then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; theſe ſhould not haſtily be refuſed; But as the Apoſtle gives counſel reſpective (as I take it) to private converſe, After once or twice admonition reject: ſo let it be here, make eſſay to regain a brother rather then loſe him. It cannot be conceived that the Apoſtle when he wrote his Epiſtle to the Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> would upon the account of their error how dangerous ſoever, have diſcontinued this ordinance as long as he ſaw any hopes of their reeſtabliſhment; though they were in eminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be diſchurched, yet he would continue Church-ordinances.</p>

Theſe men of ſin that come to the Sacrament in ſin, wilfully, furiouſly draw this guilt upon themſelves, and become acceſſary to it: <hi>He that ſleightly paſſeth over the death of an innocent perſon, making a ſmall matter of it, either he makes the innocent, to be indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, one that hath juſtly deſerved to be ſlain, who being ſlain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves ſo little regard; or at leaſt he makes himſelf nocent, breeding ajuſt ſuſpition that he was, or would have been conſenting to that mans death,</hi> ſaith M. <hi>Pemble,</hi> pag. 33. Theſe in the ſleigheſt way paſſe it over, not with the leaſt evidence of zeal or indignation againſt it.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, They that judge Chriſt fit to be numbered with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors and tranſgreſſors, diſcern not his body, do not judge of him according to his glory and excellency, and ſo cannot with comfort come to the Lords Table: But theſe judge him fit to be numbered with tranſgreſſors, when in their fouleſt ſins they dare joyn themſelves to him, and have communion with him: This is their caſe that come in ſin to the Lords Table.</p>

                        <p>Here ſome may object, that according to the principles laid down, the Ordinance may be an hopeful meanes to take ſuch off from their wayes of ſin; having previous light to ſee what they do hear they may ſee high aggravation of their wickedneſſe; An heart-breaking, a ſoul-melting Ordinance being ſet before them, there may be all hopes that it may be efficacious unto ſoul-melting and heart-breaking; here they may ſee what their ugly ſins have done, and who it is that their ſins have pierced and crucified, whereof a Publican or Harlot may eaſilier be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced then a Phariſee or juſticiary. And Chriſt being here ſet out both bearing ſin, and a ſacrifice for ſin, the ſight of their juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit in his ſuffering, and hopes of freedom from guile by his blood-ſhed; there may be expectation of conviction, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, and conſequently ſomewhat at leaſt done towards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion: and upon this account ſome would have the worſt of men admitted to the view, though not to participation in this Ordinance; Others taking advantage of this admiſſion of them to the view of it, and knowing it to be a novel thing, that any ſhould gaze, and not partake, they conclude they are to be admitted unto both. The further improvement of it by them ſeems at leaſt ſome way hopeful, when to the ignorant and erroneous it is impoſſible.</p>
                        <p>That I may ſpeak my whole thoughts to this thing, ſomewhat is neceſſary to be premiſed, both by way of conceſſion and aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. By way of conceſſion it muſt be yeelded,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That there is more weight in this objection then perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath been acknowledged, which I ſee upon conference with many godly learned is more and more diſcerned. It is not ſo eaſie to evince all hopeleſneſſe of good in a bad mans receiving the Sacrament, as in a man that is groſſely ignorant; no text ſo fully and clearly to any grounds to put a barre to men in ſin, as to thoſe that are in ignorance; neither doth the nature of the Sacrament ſo clearly evince it. 2. Arguments uſually brought to conclude againſt their admiſſion to this Ordinance that are in wayes of ſin, and under no ſentence of excommunication, ſeem to me ſcarce concluding. It were too long to name the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and point out the exceptions: Some of them alſo peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly enſnaring, and upon ſeveral accounts, 1. Their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments conclude equally againſt ſuch mens, hearing, praying, and attendance upon any other Ordinance, as they do againſt their
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:168215:131"/> participation of the Lords Supper; the ſame Medium where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they conclude againſt one, concludes againſt all, as hath been ſhewn. 2. Theſe Arguments intended: onely againſt the ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to conclude a neceſſity of their excluſion equally, conclude againſt all that are not actually in grace, when yet the diſputants themſelves will not yeeld, that either actual grace or poſitive ſignes of ſuch grace ſhould be any rule in ſuch proceedings, as to inſtance; ſome ſay that Miniſters in holding out the Sacrament to wicked perſons whom they have excommunicated in the Word, ſhewing that no unrighteous perſon ſhall enter into the kingdom of heaven, they abſolve them in the Sacrament; and if this have any force in it, it muſt conclude in this manner; None may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted but theſe that may be actually abſolved, and while they aſſume that the wicked may not be actually abſolved, others will alike aſſume, that no unregenerate man, how knowing civil and unblameable ſoever, may be abſolved. And the ſame guilt that theſe in their reaſonings conclude that Church-officers bring upon themſelves in admiſſion of the ſcandalous, they contract that admit of any ungenerate ones.</p>
                        <p>By way of aſſertion it muſt be delivered, 1.<note place="margin">2. By way of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion.</note> That the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental proper right unto, or intereſt in, this Ordinance is not queſtioned, Church members lay a juſt claime to Church Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, viſible members to viſible Ordinances; If this be once denyed we are in inextricable ſnares. 2. Here can be no ſuch prophaneneſſe in promiſcuous adminiſtration of this Ordinance, as the putting of Gods ſeal to blank paper: There is no blank, but a name legibly written where there is a Covenant entered; and that there is a Covenant entered with ſuch, as it cannot be denyed by any that will confeſſe that the Scripture ſhould be umpeir; ſo it is yeelded by all of thoſe that baptize the infants of ſuch perſons. The firſt right of parents that are ſuch is taken for granted, when their children are thus received. 3. It is then an orderly edifying and prudential wa in adminiſtration that is here enquired after, and this admits of a greater latitude then Covenant, and no Covenant regenerate or, non-regenerate in which if an hairs breadth ſhould misſe there were a tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; as we diſcern the perſon to whom it is meet to give onely milk, and to whom to give ſtrong meat, ſo we judgeof thoſe that we admit onely to the Word and Prayer, and thoſe that we admit to the Lords Table. And though I ſee not concluding
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:168215:132"/> ſtrength in ſeveral Arguments produced, but ſuppoſe they are grounded on miſtakes (which alſo apt to lead into danger, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I had been ſilent) yet I cannot recede from that ancient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived opinion of Fathers, Schoolmen, Proteſtants, whether of the Epiſcapal, Presbyterial, or Congragational judgement; that ſcandalous perſon is are juſtly dibarred from this Ordinance, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any poſſible hopes of gaining good is very low if any which yet is all that can be pretended tor the expediency; and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the other hand for the inconvenience and danger, are many and weighty. Theſe Sacramental ſignes are not barely teaching, but engaging ſignes; and not barely ſignes, but ſeals, in which by acception of theſe ſeales, we engage to God to make good his terms and propoſitions. The Miniſter of Chriſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath little encouragement, and ſlender hope: to tender it to ſuch, or to admit ſuch to it, that are in a continual way of Covenant-breaking, and proclaime to all their reſolutions in it. A continued diſſolute courſe of life ſpeaks no better then a full purpoſe, and ſetled reſolution for ſin; it can then little avail ſuch a one to take anew theſe ſymboles and badges of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian profeſſion upon him, and put himſelf on an hypocritical profeſſion of tht ſervice of Chriſt, making diſcovery of ſuch reſoluſion, it doth appear to be in vain to give this way and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to him. Knights of the poſt, that have often forſworne themſelves, are not by any prudent Judge permitted to ſweare; and thoſe that have ſo often deſperately broken Covenant, and wilfully gone againſt all former engagements, and ſtill palpably appearing that way, are as unfit to engagae; And the more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any that is produced as deponent appears to be ſuch, with more full reſolution any prudential Judge will except againſt it.</p>
                        <p>And whereas it may be objected, that ſuch upon the grounds here laid may as well be admitted to the Lords Table, as to hear Sermons, joyn in Prayers, obſerve Faſts: They are engaging Ordinances whileſt they are done by perſons in Covenant, as is receiving of this Sacrament.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, They are not certainly ſo highly and explicitely engaging; The very name Chriſtian is an engaging tye indeed to Chriſtian duties and wayes; To enjoy any further Chriſtian pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge is more; But to take theſe pledges on the tearms pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, hath ever heen accounted the higheſt.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Though the Sacrament ſerve as hath been ſaid for
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:168215:132"/> aggravation of ſin, yet as the Word is the alone means in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of ſin, ſo it hath infinitely the advantage in the aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. The Sacrament doth nothing at all in this work without the Word, and the Word does exceedingly much more then the Sacrament; and when it is clear, that the Word for ſo long hath wrought nothing for conviction, there is little hopes that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament will work any thing to aggravation.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, As the hope of good is either low or none at all, ſo the danger on the other hand is high and full of terrour, as we ſee it by the Apoſtle aggravated, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27, 28. The unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receiving of the Word is indeed of danger, and a ſavour of death to death; But the hopes are fair by hearing to be brought to worthineſſe. The danger of unworthy Communicants is far greater, and the hopes little, if any at all.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, The ſcandal here taken is exceeding great, and though happily ſometimes weak ones take more offence then is given, and are offended above reaſon, yet when there is ſo little of good to be hoped in that in which they are ſo ſcandalized, and ſo much danger in the offence, it is by no means to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, There is more fair hopes of good to be done them upon their denyal then upon admittance to this Ordinance; when they ſee their own unworthineſſe obſerved, and thoſe proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon it, they may more ſeriouſly reflect upon their unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe. When a Phyſician ſhall forbid ſome meats upon obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of a patients diſeaſe, it is a way to make him more ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that he is in danger; ſo when the Miniſter of Chriſt upon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of mens wayes, ſhall deny this Ordinance, there may be hopes of an anſwerable work to bring the perſon to ſome more ſad and ſerious reflections upon his own ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If any think that theſe arguments ſingly conſidered, not to be of that ſtrength to evince a non-admiſſion of men of open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinfull courſes to this Ordinance, I ſhall anſwer in the words of the Aſſembly of Divines, unto the reaſons of the Dſſlenting brethren againſt the inſtance of many Congragations in the Church of <hi>Epheſus: Arguments of neceſſity are to be anſwerable to the things they prove, which as well holds int hsi of expediency or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expediency,</hi> to which I ſpeak, as it doth in matter of fact, of which they ſpeak; and ſo ſay they, <hi>Though the ſeveral particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of this proof ſhould be ſingly but probabilities, yet being joyned
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:168215:133"/> together make a ſufficient proof, as many concurring likelihoods in Courts amount to a good evidence, and many leſſer ſtars make up a Galaxia.</hi> They are with me at leaſt ſo far prevailing, That I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that ſuch are worthily excluded; and as they do not come without ſcandal, ſo they cannot come to their advantage. In caſe after a former way in ſin, or ſad fall to the ſcandal of the Church, upon admonition there appear, convictions, and ſerious promiſes, the caſe is otherwiſe; there is all cauſe then to take in ſuch a one to this Ordinance, in which his ſin appears in the higheſt aggravation, and a tender and offer is made, and the way held forth of pardon and forgiveneſſe. Many of the Ancients were haſty enough to give the Sacrament to men at the inſtant of their death, as a <hi>Viaticum</hi> to heaven, when it was all too late to make any right improvement of it: But we are in the mean ſpace too ſlow, and over-rigid, in admiſſion of profeſſed penitents to it, as appeares in many examples. That of <hi>Serapion</hi> is notable mentioned by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who had lived a great while in the Church, without blame, but at laſt fell in time of perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; And often deſiring to be received again by the Church, no man hearkened to him, till at laſt being ſick, and ready to dye, he ſent a boy ſuddenly to fetch a Prieſt, who was found ſick by the meſſenger, that he could not come to him: But he gave the boy a little of the Sacrament, and bid him put it into the mans mouth; who when he had taſted of it, preſently dyed. That was expected here from the Sacrament, which it wanted, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome hidden power to carry up the ſoul for heaven and glory; and in the mean ſpace that was not ſeen for which it was inſtituted, A provocation to repentance, and corroboration, and ſtrengthning of the ſoul in wayes of holineſſe; when there was hopes of good, to accrew by it, it was denyed; and when all hopes were paſt, it was indulged. After-ages appeared more facile, but then profeſſion of repentance was turned into a form of auricular confeſſion; they might confeſſe and take penance, and be fit for the Sacrament; and ſin as ſoon as it was over, and go again to confeſſion; That formality of confeſſion put the Sacrament as they thought into a poſture of working, which ſin unconfeſt did hinder. To deny penitents, where there is any fair and poſſible hopes, by reaſon of conviction wrought, is their ſad diſcouragement; we ſee them lame, and weak, and we deny them a Crutch that is provided for them. And to receive obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:168215:133"/> ones, that without remorſe carry it on in wickedneſſe, ſeems dangerouſly to ſtrengthen them in their wayes; and not at all to help them out of their ungodly courſes. From this that hath been ſpoken, a fair anſwer therefore may be given to the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before paſt by, concerning any power in this Ordinance for converſion. And firſt, for that from the, Directory where <hi>the ignorant, ſcandalous, and prophane that live in any ſin, or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt their conſcience, are warned not to preſume, to come nigh that holy Table,</hi> it is meant of thoſe that purpoſely reſolve to hold their ſin, and doubtleſſe that purpoſe ſtanding, here is no comfort to be put into their hands. It is no other then that counſel of our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.23, 24. <hi>If thou bring thy gift to the Altar, and there remembreſt that thy brother hath ought againſt thee, leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way, firſt he reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</hi> Sacraments will not be accepted from that hand, where malice is ſeated in the heart, and implacably continued; but it followes not but that where the ſoul is ſtartled, and ſuch reſolutions for ſin do not appear, this maybe a means further to awake; and provoke to a reſolution againſt it. As to that of Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to <hi>Heathens, Pagans,</hi> enough hath been ſaid before, It can neither be done with allowance, nor any poſſible benefit. And for Excommunicate perſons, they are ſuppoſed to be in an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate way of wickedneſſe. The laſt is onely worthy of conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. <hi>That Ordinance that is not communicable nor lawfull to be adminiſtred to any known impenitent ſinner under that notion, but onely as penitent ſinners truly repenting of their ſins, is not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting but a ſealing Ordinance: But the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is not communicable nor lawfull to be adminiſtred to any known impenitent ſinner, &amp;c. Ergo.</hi> Here I might juſtly except againſt that oppoſition that is ſtill put between converting, and ſealing Ordinances; as though it muſt be taken for granted; that no ſealing Ordinance could have any hand in, or towards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. Gods ſeal added to his promiſe, may by the bleſſing of God be ſerviceable here, as well as his oath, added for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation; but this is grounded upon the miſtake of the way of the Sacraments ſealing, in which I have ſufficiently expreſſed my ſelf. For anſwer to the Argument it ſelf, The <hi>major</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is not true, unleſſe it be underſtood with juſt limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Reproof is an Ordinance that may well be reckoned among
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:168215:134"/> thoſe that work to converſion, being <hi>the way of life,</hi> Prov. 6.23. and called <hi>the reproof of life,</hi> Prov. 13.31. <hi>an excellent oyl,</hi> Pſal. 141.5. and upon that account to be uſed towards a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſin, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17. And yet prudence muſt be uſed in the application of it. Every man is not a meet ſubject to get good by it. There is no ſuch warineſſe explicitely required in the diſpenſing of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, as there is in the application of reproofs; nor yet any ſo punctually pointed out not to communicate, as there is not to be reproved. The Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans obſervation is, that <hi>He that reproveth a ſcorner, getteth to himſelf ſhame; and he that rebuketh a wicked man, getteth to himſelf a blot:</hi> Therefore he gives advice upon it, ver. 8. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, not a ſcorner, leſt he hate thee: rebuke a wiſe man, and he will love thee.</hi> Every Ordinance therefore that is for conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is not meet to be applyed to every man in an unconverted condition: Rebukes ſet out the danger of ſin, and the Lords Supper is for the aggravation of it, in holding forth the ſad effects of it, yet neither of both meet to be applyed to all in ſin. That charge of our Saviour is deliveted in an univerſal way, <hi>Caſt not holy things to dogs, nor pearles before ſwine.</hi> The Propoſition there included is general. Nothing that is holy, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is of the honour of a pearly, is to be caſt to any dog or ſwine; whence we may aſſume; But there is no converting Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, but it is of the number of holy things: <hi>Ergo.</hi> No con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Ordinances are to be given to any that are dogs and ſwine, which way ſoever any think to extricate themſelves, by putting limits to any term in the Propoſition, they muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be brought to yield, that all converting Ordinances are not promiſcuouſly to be applyed to all in ſin; But choyce muſt be made unto whom they may with profit be delivered. And thus I have ſpoke my full thoughts of the ſubjects of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, concluding without the leaſt heſitancy or ſcruple, That all in Covenant have a fundamental, or firſt right to it, a <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> and making it my buſineſſe to find out who they be that may be admitted, in expectation of benefit by it, and who are juſtly detained from it; In which I truſt I have given juſt offence on no hand, either in giving way to the admiſſion of any that according to any Scripture-rule, or juſt deduction thence ſhould be held back, and ſo hardening them in any way of ignorance or ſin, in giving them any encouragement. I have a witneſſe in
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:168215:134"/> heaven, that I intended nothing in this but to find out the mind of Jeſus Chriſt, and to have this Ordinance ſo adminiſtred, that the edification of the viſible Members of Jeſus Chriſt might be moſt prompted, and godlineſſe encouraged. And in caſe that this which I have done, may not be ſerviceable this way, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that it may prove an abortive. I know there is a diſtinction uſed by ſome, and applyed to admiſſion both of Infants to Baptiſme, and men of growth to the Lords Table; that there is a twofold title, one <hi>in foro Dei, in the Court of Heaven,</hi> and here onely the Infants of the elect regenerate have title (as they ſay) to Baptiſme, and the elect regenerate themſelves to the Lords Supper. The other <hi>in foro Eccleſiaſtico, in the Court of the Church,</hi> and here all tiie Infants of profeſſed believers have right in Baptiſme, and the knowing and not ſcandalous, though unregenerate, to the Lords Supper. By the favour of which; diſtinction, thoſe of that judgment and I may be well enough agreed; and as I think there is ſmall difference about the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be admitted to this Supper, yet for the diſtinction, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe I do not underſtand it; Both the Sacraments being Church-Ordinances, I ſuppoſe God keeps no other Court about them, ſave the Court of his Church. If they have this right <hi>in foro Eccleſiaſtico,</hi> then it is the mind of God that the Church ſhould admit them, and ſo they have right <hi>in foro Dei</hi> likewiſe. And I marvel how thoſe that bring this within the power of juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, can here apply this diſtinction, ſeeing it overthrowes that which they apply hither, <hi>Whatſoever you bind on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven; and whatſoever you looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven.</hi> Many that are admitted ma want acceptance in heaven; but having their right, and putting in no viſible barre, their confeſſed Eccleſiaſtical right concludes, that their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is with acceptance of heaven; and my great buſineſſe hath been for their comfort and encouragement that give admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that their benefiting is poſſible that are thus admitted, And here I might take into conſideration the opinion of thoſe that would have a promiſcuous admittance, and indeed I had it in my thoughts to have given a brief anſwer to Mr. <hi>Humphrey's</hi> Scriptures, and Reaſons, ſo much by ſome applauded, and ſo ſtrongly bottomed, Becauſe all Communicants muſt drink of the Cup, therefore all muſt communicate, with ſome limits, which being yielded, as I have proved they muſt, will draw the limit
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:168215:135"/> neceſſarily, yet ſomewhat more narrow. But this is by one hand already done, and I have lately had the happineſſe to ſee a ſecond learned Piece fitted for the Preſſe; dealing largely in it, which I doubt not may both ſatisfie the Adverſary and the Reader, ſo that my pains may well be ſpared; onely I cannot but take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his fourth Reaſon for a promiſcuous admiſſion, which he faith will ariſe from the <hi>vanity, formality, impoſſibility of ſelect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people to this Ordinance: Look to the heart of all theſe ſeparations, they come to nothing: For put the caſe you will have a gathered company, I pray who do you account indeed to be fit and worthy receivers? If not all that make profeſſion, as we do mixtly, then thoſe onely that have an intereſt in Chriſt, and are true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. Well, but how will you be able to know them? The heart of man is deceitfull above all things; who can know it? And if we can hardly diſcover our own hearts, how ſhall we diſcern others? ſo that all will come, but to theſe that have the faireſt ſhew, thoſe that ſeem ſuch, and you cannot be ſecured, but there may, and will be ſome hypocrites; and ſo this true partaking as all one body, and one blood, in ſuch an unmixt communion, as you pretend vaniſhes, and there can be no ſuch matter: But now if men ſtand here upon a formal purity, and will have the outward pureſt Church they can, they go to ſeparating again, and never leave ſeparating and ſeparating, (as we have daily teſtimony) till they are quite ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated one from another; Even as in the peeling of an Onion, where you may peel, and peel, till you have brought all to nothing, unleſſe to a few tears perchance, with which the eyes of good men muſt needs run over in the doing.</hi> To this I anſwer, If the rule to take in this gathered company, be intereſt in Chriſt, to take in thoſe of a ſaving intereſt, and refuſe all others, if regenerate, then he ſhall be admitted; in caſe unregenerate, then he ſhall be refuſed; then I ſhall yield his concluſion, I ſhall leave that diſtinction to him, that knowes what is in man. I ſhould fear many a man of non-intereſt might be let in, and many a man of true intereſt refuſed; a glozing tongue may here carry it, further then an upright heart. And for his next of a formal purity, to get the Church as pure as we can; though this ought to be our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, to get the Church as pure, not formally, but really, as poſſible; yet I make it no rule: But following the Apoſtles rule, to do, as all things elſe, ſo this, to edification; though it be a matter of much care and prudence, yet not vain and impoſſible
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:168215:135"/> in a good meaſure, to determine it; upon this rule I pitch, till I hear ſomething that may take me off it.</p>

If it reſpect the whole work, then thoſe that are not commiſſioned to preach Goſpel-promiſes, may yet apply Covenant-ſeales.

                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> which is againſt the judgement of the Learned of this opinion: If it barely reſpect admiſſion, and not adminiſtration, then (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:168215:138"/> we had expreſſely the mind of Chriſt to the contrary) it will appear to be the greateſt of ſoloeciſms, to give a man commiſſion for a work, and then to leave him to the courteſie of others, not otherwiſe intereſted in it, for the exerciſe of it. There did a complaint lye againſt Biſhops, giving commiſſion in Ordination large enough to preach the Goſpel; yet afterwards would not ſuffer it, without a licenſe from their Courts to be put into action. This at the firſt ſight looks much like it; when Miniſters ſhall receive power of order, which comprizes Word and Sacrament: the Goſpel with the ſeal; yet may not act in it, without an Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to overſee it, who as to adminiſtration are wholly Heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, If no other Miniſterial act, is to be preregulated <label type="milestone">

This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition hath all reaſon in it; But there is no other Miniſterial act that is to be thus preregulated, or the exerciſe of it thus ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended; <hi>Ergo</hi> there is no reaſon ſingly and ſingularly to ſubject this of Sacramental adminiſtration to it.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, If the diſpenſation of the promiſes be committed <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>3</label> to the Miniſterial prudence of the diſpenſers, without any ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction put upon them, or any other in a way of jurisdiction aſſociated with them, then there is no reaſon to be given but that they may according to Chriſtian prudence, in like manner diſpenſe the ſeales, without any ſuch juriſdiction or aſſociation. This I ſee not how any can deny, ſeeing the promiſes are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered upon the ſame termes as the ſeales: But the diſpenſation of the promiſes is committed to their Miniſterial prudence, and no other aſſociated in juriſdiction with them; This cannot be denyed. It followes then, that according to Chriſtian prudence, they may diſpenſe the ſeals, without any aſſociated in any juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction with them. If any ſhould object, that it will follow from hence, that the Sacraments are to be delivered unto all, to whom the promiſes are tendered; This I ſhall grant with theſe three limits. 1. That thoſe to whom they are tendered, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly accept them, otherwiſe the Sacraments may be delivered to Heathens. 2. That there be ſome competency of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of them, otherwiſe the moſt ignorant of the Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meni

That they do not openly and reſolvedly in their courſe of life go againſt their engagements in them. In ſuch caſe the promiſe may be tendered to Heathens, to groſſely ignorant and flagitious ones, and yet the ſeal for preſent upon theſe grounds withheld.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, Where power for any work is committed to one, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>4</label> and no other named to be imployed with him, there the work is left to the ſole care and prudence of him to whom it is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and not by power of juriſdiction veſted in many: But the work of adminiſtration of Sacraments is committed to one, and no other named to whom it is committed. The Propoſition cannot be denyed, and I know not how the Aſſumption can be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. The concluſion then followes.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, If Miniſters have not onely been veſted with power <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>5</label> for adminiſtration, but actually alſo have adminiſtred with appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, without any juriſdiction, then it is no act of juriſdiction. This cannot be denyed, ſeeing that if it were the mind of Chriſt that a juriſdiction ſhould be ſet up for adminiſtration, then the diſpenſers muſt have ſtayed for it (as <hi>Saul</hi> ought to have done for <hi>Samuel</hi>) before adminiſtration: But Miniſters have not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been in power for adminiſtration of Sacraments, but have actually adminiſtred with approbation without any juriſdiction: They have done it in unofficed Churches, where no juriſdiction had place; this is evident. To ſay nothing of <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſme, inſtance might be given in the baptiſme adminiſtred by Chriſts Diſciples we find the Eunuch, the Jayler, and others baptized, and no Elderſhip conſulted. Chriſt delivered the Lords Supper where no Elderſhip was ſet up; and in caſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42. be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the Lords Supper, (as is generally conceived) there can be no contradiction; ſeeing that it is not imaginable that as yet that order was eſtabliſhed with them.</p>
                        <p>If any ſhall object, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                           </label> that a command lay upon them to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Sacraments, which muſt in this caſe of neceſſity be obeyed, and the duty not neglected, though an Elderſhip for a more orderly and regular carriage be wanting.</p>
                        <p>To this I anſwer, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                           </label> Omiſſions ſeem better to me then a prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or a diſorderly proceeding, expreſſely againſt a Command, or Ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt; The Arke had better ſtayed where it was, then a new Cart ſhould have carried it in that diſorder
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:168215:139"/> to the place appointed for it; Better that <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Vzziah</hi> had let ſacrifice alone, then any to whom it did not appertain, ſhould have undertaken it. This therefore with me is not cogent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be confeſt, that there is no precept reſpective to ſuch juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, when there is a command for adminiſtration. I never ſaw ſufficient reaſon given, that a man ſhould break an expreſſe rule given in Command from God, rather then omit a duty of meer poſitive inſtitution: <hi>Jeroboam</hi> muſt rather have no ſacrifice then that <hi>Dan</hi> or <hi>Bethel</hi> ſhould be the place for it: And in caſe ſuch neceſſity may dſpenſe with irregularities, why may we not on the other hand be irregular? and in ſuch neceſſary want of a full and compleat order, the Miniſter who is one, and the firſt in the number of ſuch an Elderſhip, to take upon him the whole work, rather then on the one hand the adminiſtration ſhould wholly ceaſe, or on the other hand promiſcuouſly diſpenſed, where there can be no poſſible benefit received. To this I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, I was for ſome time much inclined, till that upon further examination and debate, reaſon enforced me to conclude, that the Miniſter by Divine appointment is authoritatively himſelf veſted in power for admiſſion or denyal. And if I be driven out of this, and all theſe arguments here laid down fully ſatisfied, I ſhall rather believe that the Miniſter who is one party in the power pleaded for, as before, may rather act alone in ſuch neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then either the authority it ſelf be wholly laid aſide, or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments totally diſcontinued.</p>

                           </label> If any ſhall further object, That Chriſt and his Apoſtles had virtually all offices in them, ſo that if that order could not ſo ſoon be eſtabliſhed among them; the defect in this impoſſible caſe was ſufficiently ſupplyed by the Apoſtolical Office.</p>

To deny drink to an Hydropick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or fleſh-meats to one in a Feaver, garlick or onions to a woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded perſon, or full of ulcerous ſores, is not to inflict a penalty, but to exerciſe a prudential care: But this denyal of the Sacrament to, or detaining it from the ignorant, &amp;c. is onely to withhold that which viſibly tends to danger, and cannot be improved for any advantage; Therefore it is no juridick penalty, but a buſineſſe of prudential care. And here an Objection which carries moſt colour of all that can be ſaid, is prevented, and already anſwered. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar a man upon the grounds of ignorance, error or ſcandal from that which otherwiſe were his right, and proper intereſt, belongs to the power of juriſdiction; and is a cenſure: But in this a man for ignorance, error or ſcandal, is debarred of that which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is his right, and therefore it belongs to the power of juriſdiction; and is a Church-Cenſure. To this upon the grounds before laid down, is anſwered, To debar a man of his right to his ſenſible prejudice, and to hold from him that which
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:168215:140"/> would be his preſent livelihood and comfort; is indeed a penalty or juridick cenſure; as to ſequeſter a man from his houſe and Lands, to disfranchiſe a man of his Trade, &amp;c. But for a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, a Nurſe or Phyſician, to order dyet as moſt for health, and to withdraw ſome food when digeſtion will not bear it, and it evidently appears to be of danger, is an act of prudence, and no cenſure; and ſo a Miniſter is conſidered in the, adminiſtration of Word and Sacraments.</p>

A command we have in the Goſpel for adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sacraments, as well Baptiſme as the Lords Supper; and Covenant-intereſt is our Directory (as you have heard) to lead us to thoſe that have fundamental, intereſt in them: But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning excluſion of any thus enrighted, there is nothing by way of Ordinance written: Therefore this can be no act of juriſdiction. The Aſſumption is that which many will queſtion; It lyes upon them then to quote this Law, to make known this Ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt: But inſtead of that, I ſhall ſhew upon what grounds it yet appears to me that there is none at all. If any ſuch be, it is either in plain, and full words expreſt, ſuch as the Law given to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to <hi>put out of the Camp every leper, and every one that hath an iſſue, or is defiled by the dead,</hi> Numb. 5.1, 2. or elſe it muſt be ſuch as is deduced by fair conſequence from the nature and uſe of the Sacrament, or preparation to it, or benefit received by it; That
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:168215:140"/> there is no Ordinance in ſuch plain, full words, needs not to be doubted; In all that enquiry into this ſo much controverted buſineſſe, it would have been long ſince produced. In caſe it be deduced from any ſuch conſequence as hath been ſpoken, it will hardly be made good to be an inſtituted Law, or conſtituted Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance. Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi> hath well excepted againſt the proof of inſtitutions by ſyllogiſmes, though to his great diſadvantage, in that diſpute of a Church-Covenant. Where there is an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in power, (as there was for excluſion from the Paſſeover) proof may be made up by conſequence for the latitude to diſcern who thoſe be that are within the verge of it, and concerned in it. But conſequences will hardly prove the enacting, and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting of it: I ſhall be willing to gratifie Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> in this, that parity of reaſon will ſet up no inſtitution. A good cauſe is wronged, when Ordinances of this nature are pretended, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be produced; and on the other hand, when a Miniſteriall prudence in the Stewards of Chriſt is undervalued, which might ſupply it. Let it be granted, that there is no Ordinance to debar an unexcommunicated man from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, yet a promiſcuous admiſſion will not follow; when the end and uſe of the Sacrament is conſidered, it will appear to them that have the care and charge about it, that ſome are not in a preſent aptitude for it. There is command for the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word in a way to edification, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 143, 12. yet the particular way of application ſuitable to mens capacities, ſo as to give milk to babes and children, and ſtrong meat to thoſe of growth, that have their ſenſes exerciſed, to diſcern between good and evil, is not done by any vertue of any ſpecifick particular inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, but the Miniſters prudence: VVhich prudence was exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed by <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. by Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16 12. There is no Ordinance for admiſſion to, or excluſion from private Faſts, or punctual direction, who are to be called, and received, or who paſt by; yet our Saviour Chriſt from the high nature of the duty, concludes that it is not for novices in the faith. And as it is a point of prudence, not to put a piece of new cloth in an old garment, (unwrought cloth ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand) there will be a double inconvenience, the weakneſſe of the one will not bear the ſtrength of the other, and ſo the rent that was before will be made greater, and the whole garment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come uncomely and unſuitable: nor yet to put new wine (which
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:168215:141"/> is windy, and working) into old bottles, the weakneſſe of ſuch a veſſel being not able to bear it: ſo neither had it been a point of prudence in our Saviour Chriſt, to have put ſuch an auſtere diſcipline upon the necks of his newly entred diſciples.</p>

Making it a peculiar Ordinance, we ſhall run our ſelves upon inextricable difficulties: Our Saviour laying it down in an indefinite way, All whatſoever that is holy, muſt there be underſtood; and pearles, and holy things are the ſame, one being exegetical of the other; holy things excelling other things, as far as pearles excel acorns. And by doggs and ſwine, both which were unclean in the Law, we muſt underſtand all that Scripture comprehends under thoſe names; they are both put for one, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. and ſo the reſult of all is, that no perſon in viſible uncleanneſſe muſt taſte of any thing that is holy. From which it followes, that as Chriſt thought it not fit at that preſent to gratifie a Heathen with a miracle, when he ſaid, <hi>It is not meet to take the childrens bread, and caſt it unto doggs,</hi> Matth. 15.26. So it will at no time be meet, or lawfull to preach the Goſpel to any heathen, or impenitent and unclean Chriſtian, they being no other then dogs or ſwine, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel the moſt precious of holy pearles; but underſtanding it as an exhortation to Chriſtian prudence, and obſerving the reaſon added, leſt they trample them under feet, and turn again and rent you, theſe abſurdities and ſnares will be avoided; and the reſult of all will be onely this, that the holy things of God, and rich Goſpel-pearles, are not to be communicated, where there is no poſſible expectation of doing good: But all the iſſue of it will evidently be danger to him that doth impart them, and all ſcorn and contempt of the holy things themſelve; which was the Apoſtles way of dealing, when the Jewes were filled with envy, contradicting and blaſpheming, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. and is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:168215:141"/> given in counſel by the Wiſe man, <hi>Rebuke not a ſcornor, leſt he hate thee: He that rebuketh a ſconer, getteth to himſelf a blot,</hi> Prov. 9.7. And the words being thus underſtood, though the Sacrament be not ſolely intended, yet it is not wholly exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, being of the number of thoſe holy things, about which there ſhould be all Chriſtian prudence.</p>
                        <p>That Text alſo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. is produced by ſome,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.11. vindicated.</note> as hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out an Ordinance for ſuſpenſion from the Lords Supper, <hi>But now I have written unto you, not to keep company. If any man that is called a brother, be a fornicator, or covetous or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with ſuch an one no not to eat.</hi> But it is more then ſtrange, that when the Apoſtle ſpeaks not at all of the Lords Supper in that Chapter, that he ſhould in thoſe words (in ſuch a ſort delivered) make an Ordinance about it. And it is clear in the Text, that the Apoſtle gives direction about the common courſe of our life, to ſhun all voluntary and free converſe, out of choyce for that end which he ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.14. <hi>And if any man obey not our word by this Epiſtle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be aſhamed.</hi> I will not ſtand to diſpute any conſequence that may be drawn from civil commerce to that which is religious, ſeeing (as I have ſaid) conſequences will not bear any inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or new ſetting up of Ordinances; and here I know there can be none at all, ſeeing this which the Apoſtle forbids, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from which he diſſwades, is in our own choyce, where we may forbear; and that at the Lords Table is of neceſſity, where we muſt obey; we are not to forbear our duty, though another that ſhould be kept back doth obtrude himſelf. If thoſe, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. which were defiled by a dead body, had come in their uncleanneſſe unto the Paſſeover, as thoſe of <hi>Iſſachar</hi> and <hi>Zebulun</hi> did, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 7.30. others for their ſakes ſhould not have kept abſent. Neither of theſe Texts therefore hold forth an Ordinance, but both of them Chriſtian prudence: one of them reſpecting things civil, the other that which is ſacred and religious. Thus I ſuppoſe that argument is taken off which is drawn from a ſuppoſition, that admiſſion to the Sacrament is an act of juriſdiction, in which I have been large, ſeeing I well know that many are of a different judgment. If any can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce reaſons of more ſtrength on the other hand, I ſhall be ready to yield. In the mean ſpace theſe with me are cogent, and

Anſwer 1. We can truſt it no where, but through corruption there will be danger, and no where ſo much as in the Congregational way; when a faction ſhall gain a plurality of votes &amp; it becomes a Church, then all is without redreſſe, and Elderſhips oftentimes are as likely to over-rule a Miniſter for corrupt proceedings, as to ballaſt, and keep him from them. 2. What freedom ſoever the bad may hope to gain from any ſingle hand, the good for the moſt part may be without fear, ſeeing that in publick adminiſtrations goodneſs ſo far overawes, and mens own reputations that diſpenſe them ſo prevaile, that they are in little danger of ſuſpenſion. 3. Such a ſuppoſed wicked Miniſter acts either where there is a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over him, to call into queſtion his irregularity; ſo that the wronged may have right upon appeal and complaint, or elſe, where there is no government at all, but each mans will may be a rule. In caſe there be ſuch a government, there is a redreſſe; and what he would willingly do, that he is kept from doing. In caſe there be none ſuch, but all diſorder prevails, then there is no more danger in his adminiſtration at pleaſure, then in his delivery of Doctrine at pleaſure; there is more fear of him from the Pulpit, then from the Communion Table. And when it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his prudence to divide the Word, I ſee no reaſon but that he may divide the Bread and Cup. So that all things conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, I ſuppoſe it to be moſt conſonant to Scripture, that it be left to a Miniſters prudence, according to Scripture-rule to manage it.</p>
                        <p>It is further ſaid, that this is to aſſume a power without any <label type="milestone">

Let them ſhew where any other is ſet up for it, and we will preſently yeeld it. Thoſe onely that are for promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous adminiſtration, can with any pretended colour in this way object it: and to theſe I ſuppoſe enough hath been ſpoken, that it is a neceſſary reſult from that power that is given for admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of this Ordinance: All Ordinances muſt be ſo diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:168215:143"/> that they may profit; where profit cannot follow, there is to be no diſpenſation.</p>

But when it appears that it is an act of prudence, and not of juridick cenſure, either of both are at loſſe for their intereſt. If theſe have power by their vote to let in, and keep from the Sacraments, it is either as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſers of theſe Myſteries, or by vertue of a juridick power of rule and government veſted in them. That it is not as diſpenſers, themſelves will acknowledge, for they cannot in a joynt way thus adminiſter: neither can it be by virtue of any juridick power of rule and government. In caſe it were granted, if all are in place of rule, where then are thoſe that are ruled, and under govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? If every member be an eye, where is the foot? The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſalutes the Saints, and thoſe <hi>that rule over</hi> them, Heb. 13.24. Here are no Saints but what are Rulers: <hi>Obey them that are over you in the Lord,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: theſe muſt obey one another. If theſe thus govern, and this be an act of their government, then no man muſt be admitted to the Supper, but together with it he muſt be veſted in Church-power, and rule; None muſt be a member, unleſſe he be a Commander: Chriſt's Army muſt have all leaders, no followers; all Commanders, no common Souldiers: by this means either worthy Communicants muſt be ſhut out, or men unfit for rule promoted, ſeeing every godly man that hath the ſpirit of ſanctity, hath not preſently a ſpirit of rule. Hence will follow, that confuſion by the experience of many found, and complained of by Mr. <hi>Blackwood,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> and others, not to be ſuſpected of partiality; And when they argue from their power in excommunication, to their power in barring from this Ordinance, as the antecedent is to be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo the conſequent is falſe. All the faithfull are not to decree excommunication: The meeting together mentioned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. was not of members, but officers, there being more Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations then one in <hi>Corinth,</hi> as is juſtly preſumed, and in ſome Churches is undenyably proved; and therefore their members could not meet about any act of government, but officers one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. So alſo the conſequence is falſe, and though excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were in their power, yet the power of adminiſtration of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:168215:143"/> and mens admiſſion may be in an other hand, as a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential act. And ſo every part of the argument is found faultie. It is true that excommunication being a juridical ſuſpenſion from all Church-Communion, and Participation in Church-priviledges, comprizes in it ſuſpenſion from the Lords Table, as he that is caſt out of the houſe, is no more ordered for his diet in the houſe, but kept from it. Yet there may be a non-adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Miniſter where there is not any ſuch Church-cenſure. A Chriſtian in his minority (ſuppoſe of the age of ten, or twelve years) is not upon the account of his minority to be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, yet he is not of that age, as to be admitted to the Lords Supper. And whereas it is ſaid, that it is their dutie to avoid ſuch in their converſe, that are thus denyed; I anſwer, that were it granted to be a Church-cenſure formally executed, Mr. <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therford</hi> hath ſufficiently anſwered, that their duty to avoid them under cenſure, is no argument that they are to have an hand in the cenſure: But being denyed to be any formal cenſure of the Church, there needs no further anſwer, and they are to avoid them no further then the manifeſtation of their condition, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Scripture-grounds, gives them occaſion: So they muſt avoid children, youth and all others that are not competently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in Goſpel-wayes, and (according to the principles of many of them) all thoſe that are not highly verſ'd in Chriſtian Myſteries. And as for crimes that carry the name of ſcandal, the Miniſter is in a publick way to debar none, but upon known manifeſt evidences openly ſeen; of which any may be compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent witneſſes. And in caſe they ſuffer wrong by the Miniſters imprudence or otherwiſe, they are not to ſuffer farther by other mens avoiding their ſociety, and communion. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of the faithful therefore having no power of juridick cenſure, they have no colour of claime to it under any ſuch a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And being no formal cenſure, Elderſhips that have that power, are not formally <hi>qua</hi> rulers veſted in it. It therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, that it is an act of <hi>prudence</hi> in the diſpenſer, and no act of <hi>juriſdiction</hi> in them that have right of cenſure, or inflicting of penalty.</p>

For though Governours are not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted before theſe ſeals be diſpenſ'd, yet government ſtill ſtands in due power notwithſtanding; of this we have all cauſe to be tender, ſeeing whileſt ſome diſpute in what hand to place it, others take their advantage quite to aboliſh it: But that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks of a Government diſtinct from that which is in the hands of civil powers, is a truth that carries ſuch evidence, that it can with no colour of truth be oppoſed. As the Romans divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that ſtate into <hi>Senatum populumque Romanum,</hi> implying that ſome were in power of Governing, and others were to yield ſubjection; the Spirit of God himſelf makes like diviſion of the ſtate of <hi>Iſrael</hi> into Elders and people, <hi>Ruth.</hi> 4.9. So the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebr.</hi> in like ſort diſtinguiſheth Chriſtians: <hi>Salute the Saints and thoſe that rule over you,</hi> Hebr. 13.24. Some were without any power for rule, and theſe are ſtyled Saints without any further addition; others are in power for Government, and theſe have their juſt title given them. The ſame title that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Cyrenius</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> to <hi>Pilate</hi> in <hi>Judea,</hi> Luke 2.2. Luke 3.1. is given by the Apoſtle to theſe here mentioned. <hi>A mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary or politicall word</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>which is ſpoken of a publick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who is poſſest of power either in Common Wealth, or Army.</hi> And if thoſe other texts of the Apoſtle be conſulted, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.17. 1 Tim. 5.17. 1 Tim. 5.19. 2 Cor. 2.6. and 5.12, 13. 1 Theſ. 5.12. (to mention no more) ſo much will eaſily be found in them, that ſpeaks a government within the Church it ſelf, not going out of its own limits. Whether ſome texts ordinarily produced hold out ſo large an enumeration, as is by ſome bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom'd upon them, may happily be diſputed; but that there ſhould not ſo much as any government at all be ſpoken to cannot be imagined: which thing in reaſon is alſo plain, 1. The Church is a ſociety, a viſible Kingdom, an incorporation, a body, and when all of theſe have their lawes, governours, cenſures, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, it cannot be thought that this ſociety ſhould herein ſo farre differ, and be ſo farre inferiour to all other ſocieties, as to be wholly deſtitute: when all others enjoy government, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, for their ſtrength. defence and more compleat being, the Church alone ſhall be like that City which the Wiſe man ſpeaks of, broken down, and without walls, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.28. 2. The Church conſiſts of men, as do other ſocieties ſubject to fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:168215:144"/> yea, to enormities, and exorbitances in judgement and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. There hath no age paſt in which the Church hath not had her ſchiſms, errors, and ſcandals. No ſociety or body politick is ſo like to run upon miſcarriages, ſeeing the lawes to which Chriſt ties, are ſo averſe to our natures, when we can bear others; we are apt to ſay, we will break theſe bonds, and caſt them away from us. Satan envies no other ſociety, or bond of men, as he doth the ſociety, or bond of Chriſtians. His kingdome will conſiſt together with all other ſtates and kingdomes; they may rule, and he rule likewiſe; onely this of Chriſts Kingdome, is wholly averſe to Satans; and militates againſt it, for the ruine of it. 3. The Church from the beginning hath exerciſed this power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it ſelf, when all other powers were adverſe, and contrary to it. How long was it before the Church had a Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and lay under the perſecution of heathen ſtates? in all which time a diſcipline vvas yet kept up. If the Church had no ſuch povver, hovv could it then exerciſe it? 4. The Churches that have been remiſſe in their improvement of this povver, have had their check from Chriſt himſelf in glory. He manifeſts his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure from heaven againſt the Church of <hi>Pergamos,</hi> that they had thoſe that held the doctrine of <hi>Balaam,</hi> and the doctrine of the <hi>Nicolaitans;</hi> and againſt the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> becauſe they ſuffered <hi>Jeſabel</hi> to teach and ſeduce his ſervants, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.14, 15, 20. The cenſure that lyes upon the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> upon neglect of reformation in their time, argues that they vvere in povver for it. So the cenſure of theſe Churches upon like ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count argues their povver in like manner. Even thoſe that plead moſt for freedome of conſcience, and liberty in religion, vvith all impunity from the civil povver, yet confeſſe from theſe and like texts, a povver vvithin the Church it ſelf for cenſure of delinquencies. To all this ſome are ready to ſubſcribe (as being not able to gainſay the clear Scripture evidence of a povver Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical) and confeſſe, that it vvas ſo in thoſe times, but novv they contend that the caſe is othervviſe. Providence hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a change of things, and all is ſwallowed up in the hand of him that is chief in power, ſince the time that the Church hath enjoyed Kings for her <hi>nurſing fathers,</hi> and Queens for her <hi>nurſing mothers,</hi> not barely accuſing them of error that diſſent in opinion, but charging them to reſemble thoſe ſons of <hi>Belial,</hi> that upon the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> inſtitution of Kingſhip, were ungratefully asking this
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:168215:145"/> queſtion, <hi>How ſhall this man ſave us?</hi> 1 Sam. 10.27. Making good their aſſertion of a change of this nature by this ſimilitude, <hi>As in the firſt Church among the Jewes whileſt they were in a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring condition, as their need was greater, ſo Gods perſonal provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and guidance of them was more expreſſe, and apparent, and therefore whileſt they were in this Theocraty, their government was not to be managed by any ſetled univerſal authority, beſides that of God himſelf, or any one who took not in all weighty things immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate direction from him, until ſuch time as being throughly ſettled in peace, and ſecurity from their enemies he might make his receſſe, and permit and appoint to them a King of their own Nation; So in the firſt founding of the Chriſtian Church during the time of their perſecution, as their weakneſſe required, were in a Theocraty too, guided by the expreſſe direction of our Saviour himſelf given to the Apoſtles during the time of thoſe fourty daies that he was conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with them upon earth; but now after the time that God hath perfected the time of the Churches deliverance, and free eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in peace, and reſt from all about her, and the Prophecy is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled by appointing Kings her nurſing fathers, and Queens her nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing mothers, and having ſons to be ſet as Princes in all Lands, ſo that now under Conſtantine the uproomes, and wandring Tabernacles, (as formerly under Solomon) are converted into ſtately temples, for men now to think of their running into their Wilderneſſe, and perſecuted condition, by entertaining thoſe temporary forms which unto that condition were moſt fit, doth import both ingratitude and murmur againſt God, and imprudence towards themſelves.</hi> Thus farre this ſimilitude. But thoſe of this opinion I doubt would take ill that free dealing toward themſelves, which they uſe toward others, and that upon their caſting off all Eccleſiaſtical govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, under the notion of temporary forms, we ſhould apply that ſpeech of the Lord himſelf to <hi>Samuel,</hi> concerning the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael</hi> upon their reſolution to make a change in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.7. <hi>They have not rejected thee, but they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected me, that I ſhould not reign over them.</hi> And to make the diſſimilitude in this ſimile further apparent, it ſhould I ſuppoſe be taken into conſideration, that when God was pleaſed firſt to permit, and then appoint a King over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that the former fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of Government written in the Law was not taken down, but the whole Levitical order ſtill ſtood, as to all purpoſes preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of God; the change was no more, nor further but in him
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:168215:145"/> that rul'd in chief. Inſtead of one raiſed by an immediate hand of God, as their exigence required, they now had one after the manner of other Nations, of conſtant ſtanding. And God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that we ſhould murmur, that the Church hath her ſons for Princes, and that thoſe that rule over us, ſerve the Lord Jeſus with us. But we think that theſe ſervants of Chriſt thus raiſed in honour, ſhould ſee that what Chriſt hath ſet up ſhould be aright managed, and that they ſhould have that inſpection, as the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> had, to rectifie what they find out of order, but not to pull down any thing that Jeſus Chriſt had raiſed up, no more then the praiſe-worthy Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> did that which <hi>Moſes</hi> had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; eſpecially ſeeing the Lord Chriſt, even in the ſpace of thoſe forty daies before mentioned, aſſerting his pleni-potentiary power that he had received from his Father, and giving power to his Church, declares it to be of that laſting tenure, to continue to the end of the world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18, 19, 20. And becauſe theſe words which import this continuance, are variouſly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, and ſome will underſtand them with limit to the end of the Apoſtles age, ſeeing the age of a man is often ſet out by the word <hi>ſeculum,</hi> the ſports at <hi>Rome</hi> which were ſeen once in mans age, were called <hi>ludi ſeculares,</hi> and ſo we have this text againſt us. But againſt this interpretation let the Reader obſerve, 1. The frequent uſe of the phraſe, <gap reason="foreign">

Tell as when ſhall theſe things be, what ſhall be the ſign of thy coming, and of the end of the world? none of all which can be underſtood of the end of one, but of all ages. 2. Let the context there be conſidered; Chriſt there promiſes his preſence in the work of diſcipling all Nations, but that was not the work of one age onely, many ages are paſt over, and yet many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are not diſcipled. His preſence is promiſed in the Word and Sacraments, which muſt have their continuance till Chriſts ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. The Apoſtles words, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. may well ſerve for a comment on theſe words of our Saviour; the alone place (as <hi>Gomarus</hi> notes) where this phraſe is uſed, excepting the texts out of <hi>Matthew</hi> mentioned: <hi>But now once in the end of the world he hath appeared, to put away ſin by the Sacrifice of himſelf.</hi> There are two ages of the world, one determining upon Chriſts ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:168215:146"/> reſurrection, and aſcenſion; the other commencing at that time, and concluding at the end of all time; and therefore the ſpace betwixt Chriſts firſt and ſecond comming is ordinarily cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the laſt daies. Chriſt dyed at the conſummation of the firſt, and the promiſe of his preſence is made till the conſummation of the ſecond; and the power given and received, is no otherwiſe temporary.</p>

So that as Knights appear in Parliament, not in their own names (as the Peers of the realm heretofore have done) but in the name of the reſpective Counties, and Burgeſſes in the name of their reſpective Corporations; ſo ruling Elders choſen by the vote of the people, have no other power, but what they exerciſe in the name and right of thoſe that ſet them up. Paſtors have their power primitively veſted in their own perſons by immediate appointment of Chriſt Jeſus.

As it is concluded by many that place power of admiſſion in an Elderſhip, that a Miniſter wanting that aſſiſtance, may then deliver the Sacrament to thoſe from whom otherwiſe; he ſhould withdraw his hand; and a learned Treatiſe is written to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe wanting authority to do what regularly might be done; He is not withſtanding (as is ſaid) to do his duty in adminiſtration. So I might, I think, with as much reaſon ſay, that in caſe a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter be overborn with power in his people, that he cannot do that in debarring of thoſe which his judgement leads him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,<note place="margin">When a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter cannot do what he would, he muſt do what he is able.</note> without evident hazard of the utter diſturbance of the peace of his place, he is ſcarce to run the hazard; when he cannot do the good that he would, he muſt do the good that he can; he is to do ſo much the more in publick warning of the ſin, and the danger, as he can do the leſſe in authoritative denyal, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding his hand from them. If it might appeare to me that God hath veſted an Elderſhip, and no other in that truſt, I think it were ſcarce ſafe to put a mans ſelf without them upon adminiſtration, laſt it ſhould be like to that of <hi>Saul,</hi> when he forced himſelf to offer a burnt-offering, becauſe <hi>Samuel</hi> came not in the appointed time: But no ſuch thing appearing in Scripture, nor any ſufficient reaſon evincing it, I take it to be in
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:168215:148"/> the Miniſters hands ſo to diſpenſe it, as the Church may receive moſt of edification by it. And when he is ſo overruled that he cannot act as he would, he muſt act as he can. A Steward ſet over the houſe, and a Commander or Leader in any Army is ſometimes put upon ſuch neceſſities. <hi>Suarez</hi> is as zealous as any other againſt the delivery of the Sacrament to thoſe that are unworthy of it, yet bounds it with this caution, <hi>If the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter may do it without inconvenience;</hi> And putting the objection, <hi>That not to give the Sacrament to an unworthy perſon is a negative precept, that binds</hi> ad ſemper, <hi>to all times, and therefore never to be done.</hi> He anſwers that <hi>this Precept is not ſimply Negative, but is to be reduced to an Affirmative, which is prudently and faithfully to diſpenſe this Sacrament, which being formally taken is alwayes to be obſerved, as often as this Sacrament is admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, and ſo it comes to paſſe that if it may be, it is to be denyed to thoſe that are unworthy, not that it is alwayes to be denyed upon any inconvenience whatſoever.</hi>

This might have been the employment of Angels in glory, whom he makes miniſtring Spirits, and to whoſe charge he commits his ſervants; but he hath choſen another way com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating it by man to the ſons of men; honouring men ſo farre as to entruſt them with theſe Myſteries, whereby he, 1. makes tryal of their faithfulneſſe, whom he thus entruſts in ſo noble an employment, as the diſpenſation of his Covenant, and ſeal, his Word and Sacraments. 2. He makes known his power, ſetting up weak man in his cauſe to oppoſe, and get the upper hand over Satan, and the world; <hi>chuſing the weak things of this world to confound the mighty.</hi> 3. He provides for his own glory, which would have been endangered, in caſe Angels had been employed in this Ambaſſy; when an Angel was ſent to <hi>John,</hi> he was ready to forget himſelf, in his extaſie to worſhip the Angel, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.10.22.9.

They that were ſent out to convert and inſtruct, were in commiſſion alone to baptize, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. But the Miniſters of Chriſt are ſent out to convert and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct; they onely are ſpiritual Fathers, Teachers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is their buſineſſe, as before this commiſſion it was by divine warranty practiſed by <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and afterwards accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the commiſſion through the Acts of the Apoſtles. 2. the Supper of the Lord is a ſetting forth of the death of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. and therefore alone their buſineſſe in a publick way who are to preach Chriſt crucified, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. 3. They are the ſtewards of the Myſteries of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. Theſe are of his Myſteries, the outward elements as they hold out, and ſeal Goſpel-promiſes unto us. 4. They are ſet over the houſehold of God, to give them their meat in due ſeaſon, having in charge to feed the Flock of God, which is among them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2. 5. Sacraments are a viſible Word, which never can profit, unleſſe they be opened, and the Myſtery be interpreted. 6. They are ſeales of the Goſpel-covenant, and inſtituted appendants to it, and therefore to be diſpenſed by Goſpel-Miniſters, that are in commiſſion to preach the Goſpel. And ſo Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> his quibble is againſt him. <hi>Though</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the title of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Goſpel be uſed in the New Teſtament, yet the title of the Miniſters of the Sacrament is a made title,</hi> Praecurſ. pag. 82. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are comprized in the Goſpel, and Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel comprizes Miniſters of the Sacraments. 7. All ages of the Church give in their vote with it, no Church regularly giving this power to any other;<note place="margin">Whether Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation be of the eſſence of Sacraments?</note> Yet I would have this underſtood with this caution, that I do not ſo make it of the eſſence of Sacraments in general, that no Sacrament can have any being, but in the hand of a publick Miniſter, ſeeing, for ought we can read, neither Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, nor the Paſchal Lamb were committed to the hands of men in Miniſterial function. Circumciſion was given in charge to the parent, and whether his own hand, or any others ſhould be employed in it, it is not mentioned. They might (for ought we read) make uſe of thoſe that were moſt dextrous in it. And for the Paſchal Lamb, <hi>Rivet</hi> among the Calviniſts, and <hi>Gerard</hi> among the Lutherans deny, that it was to be brought to the Priſt to offer; and though both were Sacraments, (as may be
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:168215:150"/> objected) inſtituted before the Prieſthood was ſettled, and while the firſt born were authorized for publick Miniſterial acts, yet we do not then find it charged on the firſt born, not yet afterwards veſted in the Prieſthood;<note place="margin">The negavit judged proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> neither do I yet judge it to be ſo of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrality of the Sacraments of the New Teſtament, that it ſhould be no manner of Sacrament, if it be not carried on by the hand of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, The matter and form being firſt inſtituted, the Sacrament, is after put into a Miniſters hand to diſpenſe it. And I ſee not a flat nullity of a Sacrament,<note place="margin">Goſpel order tranſgreſſed, when Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are othewiſe diſpenced.</note> but a foul breach of Goſpel-order, when that way is neglected. As <hi>David</hi> felt to his grief, and was brought to confeſſe a foul miſ-priſion, in the order of Gods worſhip, when the Ark was carried on a Cart, and not on the Levites ſhoulders, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.13. ſo it is when the Sacraments are delivered by any other hand then a Miniſters; yet the Ark (though carried as it ought not) whereſoever it was, it was yet the Ark of God; ſo theſe ordinances (though adminiſtred as they ought not) are yet ſtill Sacraments, they are ſtill divine inſtituted ordinances, where the man is ſuch that hath his intereſt, by a free Covenant grant; and the Ordinance is the ſeal appointed for ratification of this Covenant, though conveyed by an unmeet hand, it is (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) no meer nullity, though a tranſgreſſion. That of Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> Eccleſiaſtical Policy, lib. 5. Sect. 62. is worth our obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: <hi>If any thing be herein amiſſe, the harm which groweth by violation of holy ordinances, muſt altogether reſt where the bond of ſuch ordinances holds.</hi> And having ſhewed how it is otherwiſe in juriſdiction, he addes, <hi>Factum alterius alii nocere non debet. Baptiſme on the other hand being a favour which it pleaſeth God to beſtow, a benefit of the ſoul for us to receive it, and a Grace which they that deliver, are but as meer veſſels, either appointed by others, or offered on their own accord to this ſervice; of which two if they be, the one it is but their own honour, their own offence to be the other, can it poſſibly ſtand with equity and right that the faultineſſe of their preſumption in giving Baptiſme, ſhould be able to prejudice us, who by taking Baptiſme have no way offended?</hi> We juſtly abominate the opinion of Papiſts on the one hand, that make the intention of the Miniſter to be of the eſſence of the Sacrament, ſo that if that be wanting, there is no Sacrament, as alſo the opinion of Donatiſts of old, and Anabaptiſts of later times on the other hand, that make the quality of the Miniſter likewiſe eſſential; ſo that where he is defective in holineſſe and fidelity, there the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:168215:150"/> muſt of neceſſity be wanting in its power; and efficacy. And theſe opinions we reject as upon other accounts, ſo upon this that it brings Chriſtians into inextricable ſtraits, how ſhall they reach the Miniſters intention, at the time that he is about this buſineſſe; None knowes (but he that ſearcheth the heart) this thoughts at that time, and ſo no other knowes whether any more then common water hath been applyed, or commpn bread received. How ſhall they know the Miniſters goodneſſe? how ſhall they know his graces? Hypocriſie is ſpunne with a thred ſo fine, that anothers eye cannot diſcern. And in caſe the Miniſters goodneſſe were but ſeeming goodneſſe, then that which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived were but ſeeming Sacraments. This opinion of the very eſſence of Sacraments, depending on the lawfulneſſe of the call of Miniſters, puts them to little leſſe trouble. If a man will know whether he were ever baptized, he muſt be put to it, to make enquiry whether his Baptiſt were lawfully ordained, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happily dead before he is able to put this to the queſtion. And this being the Sacrament of his initiation, he may well queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whether he ſtand actually and orderly enrighted in any Church? priviledg, or be in any orderly way any Church-member, in caſe this fail? Many things being done, are of force, and ſtand firm, though he that did them deſerves no praiſe. Though they do not nullify a Sacrament, yet they break a Goſpel rule, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum valet, faciendum none eſt,</hi> is an old maxime. And the more neer men come to the place of the Miniſterial function, the more unqueſtionable is the validity of ſuch adminiſtratrions, when any aſſumes other parts of the Miniſteriall function, to officiate in publick in that way that the peoples eſteeme of him, is as of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter called to this work; thoſe that otherwiſe ſeem much to ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet then conclude, that as a Goſpel promiſe is a promiſe, though from his mouth whom God hath not ſent to preach the Goſpel, ſo a Goſpel Sacrament from his hand, is a Sacrament. The call and the work, are not ſo inviolably joyned, but that the work is done, though unduly, by him that is not called to it; yet though the validity of the work be aſſerted, the diſorder muſt be oppoſed. Entring upon <hi>Aarons</hi> work, and never called of God, as <hi>Aaron</hi> was; with <hi>Vzziah</hi> officiating in that work, that appertains not to him; leaving ſcruples in the thoughts of thoſe to whom in this diſorder they have adminiſtred theſe ordinances. This the Church hath never ſuffered, ſave onely tha Papiſts and Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:168215:151"/> diſpenſe with Baptiſme in caſe of neceſſity (putting ſo much weight upon it, and placing ſuch efficacy in it) which the Church of <hi>England</hi> alſo ſuffered after the reformation till King <hi>James</hi> his dayes, and then (as appears in the conference at Hampton-Court) it was reformed. Dr. <hi>Abbot</hi> in his Lectures read, while it ſtood in power, appeared publickly againſt it, and as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber (for the book is not in my hands) affirmed, that zealous Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters then generally did diſtaſte, and decry it. The Midwife was uſually employed in the work as neareſt at hand, to caſt water upon the infant ready to dye in her armes, though in no capacity of that function by reaſon of her ſex; and though the ſex might have born it, ſhe was never called to it. But they muſt firſt make that good, that all periſh without Baptiſme, or that the act of Baptiſme aſſures us of ſalvation, before they can juſtifie this practice, (Proteſtant Writers with irrefragable arguments op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it) produce as a diſpenſation from God for the breach of an order by him ſet up; otherwiſe we ſhall conclude that from the time of the ſaid conference, it hath juſtly been put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the lawful Miniſter; and notwithſtanding Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> his quibble, it was upon juſt grounds concluded by the late Aſſembly in their confeſſion of faith, Chapter 27.

Here I ſpeak to it onely as the intereſt in the Sacraments tyes to it: And this obligation hath all force and ſtrength in it.

The Covenant of grace is for mans reſtitution to life, none under this Covenant can find any help to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards life in any Sacraments annext to it, otherwiſe then in keeping up faith and repentance, which are the termes and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it. Which way doeſt thou expect life in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either of thy initiation, or confirmation, either in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, or the Lords Supper? is it in the Sacrament it ſelf? or is it in Chriſt that thou ſhouldeſt ſeek and look after in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? If thou lookeſt for it from Sacraments, thou Idolizeſt them and deceiveſt thy own ſoul. Bread and Wine never were, nor ever can be ſaviours: Our Fathers ate Manna in the Wilderneſſe, and are dead, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. We may eat bread at the Lords Table, and eternally dye. All <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſſe did eat of Manna, and drank of the Rock which the Apoſtle calls <hi>Spiritual meat, Spiritual drink,</hi> being Sacramentally ſuch, yet <hi>with many of them God was not well pleaſed, but they were overthrown in the Wilderneſſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.5. If thou ſayeſt thou lookeſt for life in Chriſt, I deſire to know where thou findeſt that men in unbelief have life in Chriſt. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me;</hi> and preſently adds, <hi>The life that I live in
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:168215:152"/> the fleſh, I live by faith in the Son of God,</hi> Gal. 2.20. And the ſame we may ſay of repentance, Chriſt with his own mouth denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth death and deſtruction to the impenitent, <hi>I tell you, Nay, except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh,</hi> Luk. 13. Where he gives life he gives repentaace to life, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.18. I have ſaid that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament may be improved with the help of the Word towards converſion; But if there be no ſuch change already wrought in thy ſoul, nor any ſuch thing in thy endeavour, then this great Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inance is ſadly prophaned; thou pretendeſt to Chriſt, when indeed thou treadeſt under foot the blood of Chriſt; ſeemingly wouldſt have thy intereſt in his blood, and doſt become guilty of his blood. Here Chriſts death is ſet out, his ſufferings for ſin, called to remembrance. Art not thou now affected with delight in his death when thou art affected with delight in thy ſin? when thou ſeeſt a man murthered and ſporteſt with the murtherers, with thoſe whom thou knoweſt to have had the alone hand in the murther, how then doſt not thou be come an acceſſory? This is the caſe of the man that comes to the Sacrament, and will keep his ſin. He looks not upon Chriſt Sacramentally broke to the breaking of his heart, but he looks upon him to his hearts rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing. Look upon all that hath been ſaid of the danger of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy receiving, by all that have written practically upon this ſubject; all is thy danger that art in ſin, and reſolveſt not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh: thou art admitted into the Church by Baptiſme, and upon that account art of that number, and reckoneſt thy ſelf among thoſe that are called Chriſtians, and here perhaps thou haſt hopes, highly prizeſt this priviledge; as ſometimes the Jews did circumciſion in order to the favour of God, and aſſurance of eternal life: And doubtleſſe rightly underſtood it is to be prized, otherwiſe God would not have given it, it is an <hi>honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi> or token of love to his people. Nor would the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> have ſaid that <hi>Baptiſme ſaves,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.21. But our build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of hopes upon Scripture-words without Scripture-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth undo us. When the Jewes took themſelves to be ſecure againſt all the judgements that the Prophets could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce by reaſon of ſin, upon the priviledge of circumciſion; <hi>Jeremy</hi> undervalues not circumciſion at all, but helps them to a right underſtanding of it; will have them to have it full and compleat, reckoning up many Nations by name, he ſaith, They are uncircumciſed, they were wholly deſtitute of it: and mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:168215:153"/> the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſaith, that they are uncircumciſed in heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.26. They want the beſt and choiſeſt part of it, and ſo are in the ſame condition with uncircumciſed ones; and the Apoſtle after him beating down the vain confidence of the Jewes in their outward title called Jewes, and circumciſion, which was a badge of their relation to God as a people in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, tells them, that he is not a Jew that is one outwardly, that was not enough to give a full and true denomination; but <hi>he is a Jew that is one inwardly,</hi> who is for God in ſoul, as well as in name, and <hi>circumciſion is that of the heart,</hi> Rom. 2.28. and he beats down the carnal opinion of the Jewes in circumciſion, by a definition given of the circumciſed, <hi>We are of the circumciſion, that worſhip God in Spirit and in truth,</hi> Phil. 3.3. And baptiſme of the fleſh can neither be, nor do more, then circumciſion in the fleſh: The Apoſtle therefore telling us that Baptiſme ſaves, is as willing to undeceive us, as the Prophet was to undeceive the Jewes, and tells us that he doth not mean the outward put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away of the filth of the fleſh (the application of water is but the outſide of Baptiſme) but the anſwer of a good conſcience towards God; when conſcience anſwers to that which this waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſignifies, and to which it engages, then Baptiſme ſaves, not of it ſelf, but ſeales Salvation through the Reſurrection of Chriſt; when conſcience fails in its duty, Baptiſme fails in its efficacy, then it brings not Salvation, but is an aggravation of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as after may appear. Thou art admitted to the Supper of the Lord, upon that account, that through knowledge gained, and profeſſion made, thou art in a capacity for improvement of it for eternity; But if thou ſtay here, and thy remembrance of Chriſt broken for ſin, do not work thee to brokenneſſe of heart under ſin; canſt drink of this Cup, and gulf in wickedneſſe, here is no pardon ſealed, but condemnation heightened. I know on the other hand, to diſcourage men from endeavour, ſome ſay, that there is no acting <hi>for</hi> life, but <hi>from</hi> life; what can be gained by ſin? and all actions done in unregeneration, are no other but ſin. I marvel then, what that Counſel of our Saviour means, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.27. To <hi>labour for the meat that endures to everlaſting life,</hi> The context acquaints us with the unregeneration of thoſe, to whom this Counſel is given; As alſo, what that complaint of our Saviour means, <hi>Ye will not come unto me, that ye may have life.</hi> Theſe works in unregenerate men are acts of obedience, and not
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:168215:153"/> (as is objected) ſins, onely by accidental pollution they are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; ſuch ſubtleties are above the Logick that we read in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which gives duties in charge, in reference to their reſpective ends, without conſideration of the ſtate of the ſubject under com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, whether in nature, or grace. Actions we know work to habits, and in caſe that rule hold, that. <hi>Habitus infuſi infundun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur more acquiſitorum,</hi> which Dr. <hi>Wilkin</hi> ſayes, is a golden rule in Divinity, Treatiſe of the gift of prayer, pag. 8. this is above controverſie. I yeeld to that of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that as a wheel is not made round by turning, but turnes becauſe it is round; ſo a man is not made good by doing good, but is good through grace, and then does good; as the tree is firſt good, and then brings forth good fruit. But it is not Gods way to infuſe grace into the ſoul unfitted for it, no more then it is to infuſe life into the body un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>organized. A new being is put of God into the ſoul, when reaſon appears to it, of cloſing with it. The Word, Prayer, Sacraments, may all have a hand in it. And all are in vain to the ſoul, Word, Prayer, and Sacraments, with all other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and endeavours, unleſſe they lead the ſoul to it; make it thy buſineſſe to come up to the Covenant, or elſe it is without fruit, that thou comeſt to the Sacrament.</p>

                        <p>THe next Obſervation that the words offer, is,<note place="margin">Sacraments are not arbitrary but neceſſary.</note> 
                           <hi>That Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not arbitrary, but neceſſary;</hi> the Covenant-people of God, not onely may, but muſt partake of them. As God appointed, ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> received this ſign of circumciſion: And as he received it, ſo all in confederation with him received it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.23. <hi>And Abraham took Iſhmael his ſon, and all that were born in his houſe, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abrahams houſe, and circumciſed the fleſh of their foreskin, in the ſelf-ſame day, as God had ſaid unto him.</hi> And the ſtated time for circumciſion of thoſe children who were born of parents in Covenant, being the eighth day, the text tells us, <hi>That Abraham circumciſed his ſon Iſaac, being
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:168215:154"/> eight dayes old, as God Commanded him,</hi> Gen. 21.4. And when <hi>Moſes</hi> had a ſon born in his exile, and had neglected this duty; The Lord met him in his way from <hi>Midian</hi> to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſought to kill him, <hi>Exrd.</hi> 4.24. he appeared in ſome formidable way of death to him, in that way (as many do conjecture) that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to <hi>Balaam</hi> on his way, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.23. Not that God really intended his death whom he now employed in that great work to deliver his people out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but he appeared in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, to let him know what his ſin deſerved, and by theſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors to bring him and his wife to take the courſe after mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for prevention of it. And though there have been ſome that have gone about to aſſign other cauſes of Gods anger againſt hith, and this apparition in ſuch terror, yet no other in the text appearing, and God departing from him, upon the childs circumciſion; the neglect of that Command was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the cauſe of it. Whatſoever reaſon moved <hi>Moſes</hi> to this neglect, whether the fear of diſpleaſing his father in law, or his wife, (which <hi>Rivet</hi> judges to be moſt probable) certain it is from the Lords diſpleaſure againſt him, that it was his ſin. This was after given in charge by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the people of God, <hi>Levit.</hi> 12.3. ſpeaking of the birth of a man-child, he ſaith, <hi>The eighth day the fleſh of his foreskin ſhall be circumciſed.</hi> This the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> (except the intermiſſion of it in the wilderneſſe) exactly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; when the eighth day happened on the Sabbath, that work was yet obſerved, as Chriſt notes, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.23. <hi>On the Sabbath day they received circumciſion, that the Law of Moſes might not be broken; John Baptiſt</hi> therefore on the eighth day was circumciſed, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.59. and Chriſt himſelf on that day was circumciſed, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.21. as alſo <hi>Paul,</hi> Philip. 3.5. That of the Paſſeover was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed 400. years at the leaſt, after circumciſion. It had its firſt inſtitution in <hi>Egypt,</hi> Exod. 12.3, 4. &amp;c. <hi>to be obſerved as a feaſt to the Lord, throughout their generations, to be kept as an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for ever,</hi> ver. 14. It was again commanded by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and inſerted into the body of the Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.4. <hi>Numb.</hi> 28.16. This was carefully obſerved by the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in their generations, though at ſome times when Idolatry prevailed, ſinfully neglected. We read of many famous Paſſeovers obſerved; <hi>viz.</hi> In <hi>Joſhua's</hi> time, in <hi>Hezekiah's,</hi> in <hi>Joſiah's</hi> dayes, alſo by <hi>Ezra</hi> upon the return of Gods people out of the captivity of <hi>Babylon, Ezra</hi> 6.19. It is obſerved of the Lord Chriſt, that he
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:168215:154"/> kept four Paſſeovers after the time that he publickly appeared as the Meſſiah. The laſt was the evening before his death, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which he ſaid, With a deſire have I deſired to eat this Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over with you before I dye, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.15. With extreme earneſt affection he was carried towards it, and then he put a period to it, and did inſtitute his Supper in the place and room of it. That heavy menace, ſo frequently threatened in the Law, of being <hi>cut off from among their people,</hi> is given out againſt the neglect of both of theſe Sacraments, <hi>Gen</hi> 17.14. <hi>The uncircumciſed manchild whoſe fleſh of his foreskin is not circumciſed, that ſoul ſhall be cut off from his people, he hath broken my Covenant,</hi> Num. 9.13. <hi>The man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the Paſſeover; even the ſame ſoul ſhall be cut off from his people, becauſe he brought not the offering of the Lord in his appointed ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that man ſhall bear his ſin;</hi> which commination however we do interpret it, whether of the more immediate hand of God, as dying childleſſe: The caſe of <hi>Jeconiah,</hi> Jer. 22.30. or being cut off by untimely death: The caſe of <hi>Er</hi> and <hi>Onan,</hi> Gen. 38.1.9. and of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> Levit. 10.2. or periſhing everlaſtingly: The caſe of all preſumtuous and inpenitent ſiners, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9. or whether the execution be committed to man, and that either the temporal Magiſtrate, which was the caſe of <hi>Achan, Joſh.</hi> 7. and of <hi>Shelomiths</hi> ſon, <hi>Levit.</hi> 24.14. or by Eccleſiaſtical cenſure, which was the caſe of the inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.13. As there be that appear for each of theſe, which way ſoever it is underſtood, it ſufficiently proves a neceſſity of theſe Ordinances. For the Sacraments of the New Teſtament when <hi>John</hi> baptiſed, and the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did refuſe to ſubmit to his Baptiſme, the text ſaith, <hi>They rejected the Counſel of God againſt themſelves,</hi> Luk. 7.30. and the Commiſſion given to the Apoſtles, to <hi>diſciple all Nations, baptizing them,</hi> Matth. 28.19. implyes a neceſſity of all diſcipled ones, to ſubmit to Baptiſme, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Faith is of abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity in all that hear the tender of the Goſpel, and therefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, <hi>He that believeth not ſhall be damned;</hi> and Baptiſme is the ordinary way ſet up of God, that leads to it. <hi>Peter</hi> counſels his converts, when he had them in an hopeful way, <hi>Repent and be Baptized,</hi> Act. 2.28. And <hi>Ananias</hi> counſels <hi>Paul, Ariſe, why tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieſt thou? and be baptized,</hi> Act. 22.16. For the Lord Supper we find it under a precept, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24, 25. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.19. <hi>Do this in
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:168215:155"/> remembrance of me,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.28. <hi>Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of this Bread, and drink of this Cup,</hi> implies as a preparation for it; ſo alſo a neceſſity, that we eat and drink of it; ſo that every Sacrament hath its injunction upon it.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, The inſtitution of it is a ſufficient proof of the neceſſity. God did never inſtitute it to have it neglected; There is ſtrength in that argument from the gift to the uſe,<note place="margin">Arguments evincing the neceſſity of Sacraments.</note> from the fruition of any thing from the hand of God (as the ſervant the talent from his Maſter) to the improvement of it. Theſe are inſtituted of God for his people, and therefore for the uſe of his people. That which the Apoſtle ſpeaks reſpective to Goſpel ordinances in general, may be applyed to any one in particular; <hi>We beſeech you, that ye receive not the grace of God in vain,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.1.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Frequent explicite commands are added (as we have ſeen in the Scripture proofs) reſpective to either of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments; and though no other reaſon could be rendred, yet the Soveraignty of heaven muſt be obeyed. When the young Prophet that came from <hi>Judah,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. did eat bread upon his return, expreſſely contrary to the command of God, we know the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that followed, when the like command is broke in refuſal to eat, there is the like danger; God hath power in poſitives, as well as negatives, in commanding of eating, as he hath in forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, As it is a duty, ſo alſo a priviledg; we obey a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand when we receive a Sacrament, and alſo take a gift. And the ſleighting of Gods favours, equals the evil of diſobedience to his commands. What ſin ſuffers more then theirs, that upon call, refuſe to come to the wedding ſupper? The gift is annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the duty. <hi>Take eat, this is my body;</hi> they that do not eat, have not the promiſe.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, Our neceſſity calls us to it, we have proved the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be an heart-breaking ordinance, and there is none that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it to be a ſoule ſtrengthening ordinance. Hunger will make haſte to run to meat, guilt to pardon, and pain to eaſe, and ſorrow to comfort; were we as ſenſible of our hunger, or guilt, we ſhould make equal haſte to Chriſt in each ordinance, in this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. Thoſe that are agreed about the neceſſity of Sacraments, are yet at difference about the degree, or kind of their neceſſity. That diſtinction of neceſſity by precept, or command of God, and neceſſity as a means whereby ſalvation is gained, is well
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:168215:155"/> known<note n="a" place="margin">Adverſarii fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentur Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta eſſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaria quia praecepta, et etiam neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ira ut media utilia: non ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men agnoſcunt ullum Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarium, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliciter ut me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium.</note> 
                           <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaies, we yield to them the former, that there is the neceſſity of a divine command upon them, And they alſo yield to us that no other Sacraments of theirs are any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe neceſſary, except Baptiſme and repentance. And we fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yield that repentance is of neceſſity in the moſt abſolute ſenſe; being underſtood of the change of the heart or converſion to God. But not under any notion of a Sacrament. As to their Sacramental repentance, ſtanding in confeſſion in the eares of a Prieſt, taking pennance, and receiving abſolution from him, we do not ſo much as acknowledg any command of God concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them; All the diſpute then is about Baptiſme, In which alſo we cannot grant, that there is a command given of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, but we muſt yield that it is neceſſary as a means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God in his ordinary way, carries us on by his grace to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; onely we deny ſuch an abſolute neceſſity of it, as that no ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation can be obtained without it. They yet yield that deſire of Baptiſme doth ſupply the want of it, and we yield that thoſe of years, that neither have it nor deſire it, cannot be excluded from contempt of it. This growing out of error, as in <hi>Socinians,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The kind or degree of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</note> and others, we ſay it is dangerous, but do not preſently conclude it damnable. But the want of it, where there can be no deſire of it, as in infants, they make damnable; in which we wholly are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, and cannot yield a neceſſity of that height in it. We have our reaſons.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, Salvation was not tied to Sacraments in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; not to circumciſion, in room of which we have baptiſme, and is by the Apoſtle called by the name of Baptiſme, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11. This is clear by the delay of it, according to Gods command, to the eighth day. If thoſe periſhed that died in the mean ſpace, which was the caſe of <hi>Davids</hi> child, their parents obedience of Gods command brought them to perdition. And ſalvation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not tied to Sacraments, but attainable without them, in the daies of the Old Teſtament, there is no cauſe to believe, that in the New Teſtament, there ſhould be reſtraint. The promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Goſpel did not ſtreighten grace, or make the way leſſe paſſeable to life and glory.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, They that are in Covenant with God, are upon that account in capacity of Salvation. This is plain; what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage is gained by Covenant, if ſalvation be denyed? But ſuch are in Covenant, many ſuch that never were baptized. This is
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:168215:156"/> as clear. <hi>I will be thy God and the God of thy ſeed;</hi> aſſoone as <hi>Abraham</hi> had a child, he had a child in Covenant, which howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Jeſuits, and after them Anabaptiſts would underſtand of the ſpiritual ſeed, yet God (as we ſee through the Old Teſtament) ownes them as his in a greater latitude. Thoſe to whom he gave the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> are his ſeed there mentioned: But he gave not the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to the ſpiritual ſeed onely: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they onely are not the ſeed there mentioned. The New Teſtament holds it out, in as great latitude, as I have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſhewed.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, As <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the faithful came into a ſtate of juſtification, and ſalvation, ſo others may attain to it in like ſort; This is evident of it ſelf: But <hi>Abraham</hi> was in a ſtate of juſtification, without application of any Sacrament in his ſtate of uncircumciſion, and not of Circumciſion, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle argues, by computing the time, when it was ſaid of him, that <hi>he believed the Lord, and it was accounted unto him for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> Rom. 4.9, 10.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, If Baptiſme be of this abſolute neceſſity, that rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is affixt to it, and none can be ſaved without it, then it is in mans power to ſave; and deſtroy, as is ſaid of <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar, whom he would he ſlew, and whom he would he kept alive,</hi> Dan. 5.19. which was the higheſt pitch of prerogative in regard of the outward man; ſo it may be ſaid of man reſpective to eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of bliſſe, or miſery; according to them the meaneſt midwife may Baptize them ready to give up the Ghoſt, and ſave them, neglect them, and damne them. The Infant ſet out in type, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. And <hi>Moſes</hi> in the flags, lay ſadly at mans mercy for this fading life; but thouſands of infants, are alike at mercy, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this tenent, for eternity.</p>

                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though it be not eaſy to determine, what is the right meaning, (and genuine interpretation of thoſe words, yet it is of no great difficulty to vindicate them, from them that would faſten this ſenſe upon them, and gather this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence from them; And before I come to a full anſwer, I ſhall premiſe two things. 1. That it is a wonder that <hi>Nicodemus</hi> coming to our Saviour in the night, and as yet knowing nothing in the Myſtery of Chriſt, ſhould hear that from him, that others in the open light, and farre more knowing in Chriſtianity, could never hear from his mouth. 2. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf (as <hi>Ameſius</hi> doth obſerve) confeſſes (and if I do not much miſtake, <hi>Suarez</hi> ſomewhere) that at that time of Chriſts conference with <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus,</hi> there was no ſuch abſolute neceſſity of Baptiſme. He puts the queſtion when baptiſme began to be neceſſary, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines it in four propoſitions.<note place="margin">Baptiſmus Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>ſti non fuit neceſſarius neceſſitate me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dii aut praecep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti ante Chriſti mortem. Baptiſmus Chriſti coepit eſſe neceſſarius neceſſitate medii &amp; prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepti a die pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſtes.</note> The third is, <hi>That it was not neceſſary before the death of Chriſt, neither neceſſitate praecepti, or medii.</hi> The fourth is, <hi>that it was not neceſſary, neceſſitate me dii, &amp; praecepti, before the day of Pentecoſt.</hi> And let any judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be probable, inſtructing that novice in the faith, Chriſt would in the firſt place inform him, not what in preſent, but what afterwards would be of neceſſity, eſpecially ſeeing that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that time by him ſet down, when the abſolute neceſſity ſhould commence, we hear of no ſuch neceſſity of it. For more full ſatisfaction, I further anſwer,</p>
                        <p>Firſt, That text which names not Baptiſme, and cannot be concluded by an argument infallibly cogent to ſpeak of Baptiſme cannot enforce an abſolute neceſſity of it; This is cleare: But this text names not Baptiſme, neither is there any argument to conclude infallibly, that it ſpeaks of baptiſme; probabilities are mentioned, but no neceſſary concluding argument is by any produced.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, A Scripture-text carrying like colour, hath been urged for a like neceſſity for infants to receive the Lords Supper, <hi>John</hi> 6.53. But this is agreed on all parties not to hold: This then how eagerly ſoever it is preſt, may fail like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Either water there muſt be taken for Baptiſme of water, or elſe by way of Exegeſis to hold out the ſame thing that was expreſt before by the birth of the Spirit. If the latter will hold, as there are many parallel inſtances given, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:168215:157"/> of Divines ſo interprete it (<hi>Gerrard</hi> in his common places reckons up many more then I have to conſult) then this text comes to nothing in this particular. And that this ſhould be the meaning, <hi>Chamier</hi> with fair probabilities argues, ſeeing in this ſenſe, the words bear an abſolute truth without any limitation. All being of a corrupt birth there is a neceſſity of a new birth, and that by the Spirit, there being no more births then that of the fleſh (which is corrupt) and that of the Spirit, that comes to heal corruption. If the former ſtand, that water muſt of neceſſity hold out Baptiſme of water, as Papiſts and Lutherans generally contend, and many Proteſtants yield, then either the words muſt be taken in an abſolute way, without any limit at all, or elſe with their juſt and due limitations; If limits muſt be put, then no abſolute unlimitted neceſſity can be concluded; and to underſtand it without any limit at all, our adverſaries themſelves ſee to be lyable to dangerous abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                        <p>Some therefore underſtand it of the Baptiſme of water, or ſome other that ſupplies the place and room of it; and it is on all hands granted, that <hi>Baptiſmus flaminis &amp; ſanguinis,</hi> the Spirit, or blood in Martyrdome, may ſupply the room of it for ſalvation. And this <hi>Chamier</hi> ſaies, is the limit that <hi>Arboreus</hi> puts. Others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it of Baptiſme of water, if it can be had, and it be not contemned and deſpiſed, and this <hi>Chamier</hi> ſaies is the limit that <hi>Lombard, Bonaventure, Gorran, Carthuſian,</hi> and <hi>Villagadus</hi> put to it. Others underſtand it of that regeneration, that is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily by baptiſme of water, though by other meanes it may be wrought. And this limit <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Hales</hi> puts to it, as <hi>Ameſius</hi> obſerves, either of actual Baptiſme, or elſe of the deſire of it, and this <hi>Suarez</hi> ſayes is the opinion of all Divines, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges it for an hereſy to hold, that none of years can be ſaved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe actually baptized, notwithſtanding their earneſt deſire of it; and in his time, he ſaies, one a <hi>Michael Baius</hi> a Divine of <hi>Lovain</hi> held it, But as (he ſaies) <hi>Pius</hi> 5. and <hi>Gregorius</hi> 13. in their let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters publiſhed did condemne it. And this text being ſubject to ſo many limitations, our adverſaries being judges; I hope I may without any juſt exception adde one, that it be underſtood of men of years, ſuch as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> was, to whom it was ſpoken; ſeeing ſo many helps are provided for men of yeares in the want of Baptiſme, it is altogether unreaſonable to leave Infants in
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:168215:157"/> ſuch exigents, as to be irremedileſly under damnation for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, when it is not in their power to make proviſion of it, and ſo are holpen by <hi>Lombard,</hi> and thoſe of that party: Any man may be their Compurgitor that they are not guilty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of it. Beſides this Text, there are many high ſpeeches alledged out of ſome of the Ancient for the neceſſity of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and heavy doom of thoſe that paſſe out of this world in the want of it. But theſe are not onely under the diſlike of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, but of thoſe that theſe lay claim to be of their own party. <hi>Bernard,</hi> Epiſt. 77. is large againſt them; and <hi>Voſſius</hi> hath a full quotation out of <hi>Petrus Bleſſenſis,</hi> who was <hi>Bernards</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary.<note n="c" place="margin">Sufficit Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus &amp; aqua: Sufficit Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus &amp; ſanguis, ſi aquam non excluſit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptus Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gionis, ſed ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulus neceſſitatis: Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciet ſolus Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus, quia teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monium ipſius pondus habet.</note>

The Spirit alone may ſuffice, for his teſtimony hath weight in it.</hi> And whereas <hi>Auſtin</hi> of all other is moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently quoted for this rigid ſentence, as being in name moſt eminent, my author ſets <hi>Austine</hi> againſt <hi>Auſtin,</hi> having in his 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.

                           </note>FIrſt, <hi>that Sacraments both of the Old, and New Teſtament, are standing Ordinances, to be obſerved of the people of God, not barely in the generation in which they were ſet up, but in all ſucceſſive generations; ſo that there is an abiding and laſting neceſſity in them.</hi> This is in that punctuall way ſet down in Scriptures reſpective to each Sacrament, as though the Spirit of God would let us know, that he did foreſee a generation ready to ariſe, to throw them off, and live above them, or elſe to vilifie them, as unnece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſary, indifferent and arbitrary. For circumciſion, ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.12, 13. <hi>He that is eight dayes old, ſhall be circumciſed among you, every man-child in your generations: he that is born in the houſe, or bought with money of any ſtranger which is not of thy ſeed, he that is born in thy houſe, and he that is bought with thy money muſt needs be circumciſed, and my Covenant ſhall be in your fleſh for an everlaſting Covenant.</hi> God layes there a neceſſity upon it, a laſting neceſſity in all ſucceeding generations of that people to be obſerved; and when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeveral generations afterwards did as we have heard omit it; upon what reaſon we have nothing but conjecture. We ſee, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.24. how much God was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed at it. And for the Paſſeover, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.13. we find a like laſting injunction, <hi>This day ſhall be unto you for a memoriall, and you ſhall keep it a feaſt unto the Lord, thorowout your genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: you ſhall keep it a feaſt by an Ordinance for ever:</hi> repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted again, ver. 17. It was an Ordinance that no Jew in any ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration might antiquate, or put a period unto. It muſt laſt as long as they remained a diſtinct generation unto God, even till Chriſt (in whoſe hands are times and ſeaſons, in whom there is neither Jew nor Greek) ſhould be the end of it. As to New Teſtament-Sacraments the Scripture is as clear; when Chriſt gave commiſſion for diſcipling Nations, and baptizing them, for their encouragement in the work, he promiſes his preſence unto the end of the world: The work is to continue as long as Chriſts preſence in the work continues: But Chriſts preſence
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:168215:158"/> according to promiſe, is to continue with them in diſcipling of Nations, and baptizing them, being diſcipled, unto the end of the world. I am not ignorant of the Critical obſervation that is made of the phraſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>ſaeculi,</hi> by reaſon of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious acceptation of it in Scriptures, endeavouring to have it to be underſtood of the end of that age, in which thoſe lived to whom Chriſt ſpake. But neither the parallel uſe of the word by <hi>Matthew,</hi> nor the context will bear that evaſion. For the parallel uſe of the phraſe by <hi>Matthew</hi> four places may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced in, three in one Chapter, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.39. The harveſt is the end of the world, verſ. 40. <hi>As therefore the tares are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and burnt in the fire, ſo ſhall it be in the end of this world,</hi> verſ. 49. <hi>So ſhall it be at the end of the world, the Angels ſhall come forth, and ſever the wicked from among the juſt,</hi> Matth. 24.3. <hi>Tell us when ſhall theſe things be? and what ſhall be the ſign of the coming, and of the end of the world?</hi> In all places the phraſe is the ſame, and the words can be underſtood in none of them with that limitation: And that the context will not bear it, enough may be gathered from that which I have ſaid, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the Covenant, pag. 117. For a more clear diſcovery of the words, we know that there is a double period of ages, or generations in Scripture: One at Chriſts firſt, coming, when an end was put to Circumciſion, and the Paſſeover; of this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. <hi>But now once in the end of the world hath he appeared, to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf:</hi> at the end of that world Chriſt dyed. The other is at his ſecond coming, and this is the end of the world here mentioned; and upon this account Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> in this Sermons upon <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. interprets that of Chriſt concerning the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, that it ſhall never be forgiven in this life, nor in the life to come, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.32. of the age in which Chriſt lived, and now near to an end, and the age that ſhould follow from his death till his ſecond coming; neither under the Old, nor New Teſtament, or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, can that ſin find remiſſion. Till Chriſts ſecond return, a Miniſtery, and Baptiſme muſt ſtill remain. For the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Scripture-teſtimony is as clear, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. <hi>As often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do ſhew forth the Lords death till he come.</hi> If we can believe a coming of Chriſt for a temporal Reign, before the time of his, coming to the general Judgment, I ſhall believe that may be called the conſummation,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:168215:159"/> end or finiſhing of this generation; and then a period may be put to theſe and other Ordinances. But howſoever that will anſwer, or fail mens expectations, certain it is, that it is the mind of Chriſt that they ſhall ſtand, till the time that he doth come; and then his mind will be further known. The practice of the Church hath hitherto anſwered theſe teſtimonies. All ages of the Church (as we know) held up Circumciſion till Chriſts time, and in Chriſts time it was in uſe, as Chriſt teſtifies, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.22. and he ſubmits to it in his own perſon, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. and ſo we may ſay of the Paſſeover notwithſtanding ſome diſuſe, the godly ever knew it to be in force, or elſe, as piety broke forth, they had not ſtill reaſſumed it. And Chriſt dying (as we have heard) at the end of that world, the day that he was to dye, he held a paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over. In New Teſtament-times not onely through the Apoſtles times, but to this time, Baptiſme and the Lords Supper have continued. Reaſons may alſo enforce this as to Sacraments in general, ſo to Baptiſme and the Lords Supper in particular. 1. The Covenant is to be kept for ever, there is no diſpenſation at any time for the breach of it; The ſeals then which by Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution are appointed as appendants to it, muſt be continued. As reaſon it ſelf may ſpeak enough for the validity of this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, ſo the Text of Scripture likewiſe confirms it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7, 13. compared, <hi>I will eſtabliſh my Covenant between me, and thee, and thy ſeed after thee, in their generations for an everlaſting Covenant; to be a God unto thee, and unto thy ſeed after thee. He that is born in thy houſe, and he that is bought with thy money, muſt needs be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed; and my Covenant ſhall be in your fleſh, for an everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi> 2. We have as much need as ever, this generation as any other generation, to have our weakneſſes ſupported, our faith ſtrengthened; there is not any benefit ever gained by a Sacrament, but as primitive times did, ſo we may reap ſpiritual advantage by it. For reaſons for the perpetuity of Baptiſme, Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> pag. 341, 342. of his Treatiſe of Infants Church-memberſhip and Baptiſme, hath furniſhed the Reader with plenty; of ten that he urges, I judg nine at leaſt to be unqueſtionable; to which I ſhall adde onely one, and that is ſuch a one, that with weakneſſe enough hath been brought by ſome for warranty of the diſuſe of it. If the gift of the Spirit be laſting, and continuing in the Church, then the uſe of Baptiſme is laſting and continuing likewiſe: But the gift of the Spirit is laſting and continuing: <hi>Ergo.</hi> The aſſumption, that the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:168215:159"/> Spirit is a laſting gift, I ſuppoſe none will queſtion. The <hi>major</hi> Propoſition is grounded on the Apoſtles words, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.47. <hi>Can any man forbid water, that theſe ſhould not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghoſt as well as we?</hi> When others do reaſon from the having of the Spirit, to the needleneſſe of Baptiſme, the Apoſtle diſputes in the direct oppoſite manner, where the Spirit is, there Baptiſme is not to be denyed. For the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, we may likewiſe evince the conſtant ſtanding neceſſity of it: 1. The death of Chriſt is to be ſhewed forth conſtantly, and every way preached: This is a ſhewing forth of the death of Chriſt, a means of declaring of him cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. 2. The memorial of Chriſt is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and endeared; This is for his memorial, done in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him, <hi>Matth</hi> 26. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. If the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from <hi>Egypt</hi> muſt be kept as a memorial for ever in that Ordinance of the Paſſeover, then much more the remembrance of Chriſt in his Supper. 3. Every way of Communion with Chriſt is to be preſerved, and upheld; This is a way of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. 4. Union with the Members of Chriſt is to be ſtudied; This is the way of our union with the Members of Chriſt, and therefore this is to be continued. I ſhall not enlarge much for refutation of Objections of thoſe that in our times are contrarily minded, ſeeing I have read little of any thing that they have to ſay; a noiſe is abroad of ſuch (with whom I have had ſmall converſe) that cry down rebaptiſme, by the denyal of Baptiſme; as <hi>Lucian</hi> made it his buſineſſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute Polytheiſme, by bringing in of Atheiſme; made himſelf merry with the Pagans rabble of gods, by believing no God; Oppoſition of errour ordinarily leads men into oppoſite errors; but a better way may be found for the overthrow of a double Baptiſme, then by the nullifying of all baptiſme. One God aſſerted by the Apoſtle will overthrow Atheiſme and Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme, and one Baptiſme aſſerted by him in the ſame place will overthrow Anabaptiſme. But theſe are not the firſt founders of this opinion: <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> Hereſ. 46. ſaith,<note n="e" place="margin">Baptiſmum in aqua nihil cuiquam per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibent ſalutis adferre, nec quenquam eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zandum pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.</note>

                        <p>Secondly, Gods diſpleaſure never ſhewed it ſelf ſo high, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the neglect of the Paſſeover, as upon the neglect of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, though the penalty threatned is the ſame in both, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.14. <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.13. God never appeared, that we read, for the death of any, upon that account, as he did for the death
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:168215:160"/> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> upon the neglect of Circumciſion. Reverend Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> makes the like danger to be in the neglect of Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, as we may ſee in the Preface to his Book on that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, To be utterly out of the Church, muſt needs be of greater danger, then to want ſome one Ordinance in the Church.<note n="i" place="margin">Extra Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiam nulla Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</note> 
                           <hi>Out of the Church there is no ſalvation,</hi> is an old Rule, which <hi>Acts</hi> 2.47. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.25. abundantly confirm, that is, without it, and all right of relation to it, and to be without right, and to live in the neglect and deſpiſal of it, (being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the neceſſity of it) are alike dangerous.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, No ſuch brand can lye on the want of the one, as the other; none equal to that of uncircumciſion, can be faſtened upon the want of any other priviledge: But leſt excuſing <hi>à tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> I ſhould be though to excuſe <hi>à toto,</hi> in comparing the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, I ſhould be though to deny any danger in the want of this later, I ſhall ceaſe.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>As the Paſſeover in Iſrael, both in the wilderneſſe,</hi>

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:168215:161"/> to the end. As for <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.25. &amp; 13.45. where the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for celebration of the Paſſeover is given in charge to be obſerved, when they came into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have <hi>Canaan</hi> by the gift of God for their habitation, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of that place, where it was in all their generations to be obſerved (and no notice taken of any ſuch halt, that they were to make in the way, which their ſin did afterwards occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion): But it is no prohibition of it in the way thither, or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty for omiſſion, when the time was thus protracted for their arrival there; having the Tabernacle with them, they had their liberty for obſervation of it: which is clear to me, from <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.10, 11. <hi>When ye go over Jordan and dwell in the Land, which the Lord your God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you reſt from all your enemies round about, ſo that ye dwell in ſafety, then there ſhall be a place, which the Lord your God ſhall chooſe, to cauſe his Name to dwell there, thither ſhall ye bring all that I command you.</hi> But before they paſſed <hi>Jordan,</hi> while <hi>Moſes</hi> was with them, as you have heard, they had their offerings, which is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther plain, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.17, 18, 46.47. and ſo might have had their Paſſeover likewiſe. As the Paſſeover was diſcontinued in the Wilderneſſe; ſo it was alſo oftentimes in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> we read of no more Paſſeovers then one, that was kept by <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhuah. Joſiah</hi> in the eighth year of his Reign, began to ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the God of his Fathers; and in the twelfth year he began to purge <hi>Judah,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from the high places, and the groves, and the carved Images, and the molten Images, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.3, 4. But it was in the eighteenth year of his Reign that he could reach to keep a Paſſeover, Chap. 35.19. <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> as appears, haſted to keep a Paſſeover, yet durſt not be over-haſty, he could not keep it on the day which originally in the Law was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But upon advice put it off to the ſecond moneth, becauſe the Prieſts had not ſanctified themſelves ſufficiently, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 30.3. <hi>Ezra</hi> kept a Paſſeover upon the return out of the Captivity, <hi>Ezra</hi> 6.19. and the reaſon is given, verſ. 20, 21. <hi>For the Prieſts and Levites were purified together, all of them were pure, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Paſſeover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the Prieſts, and for themſelves; and the children of Iſrael, which were come again out of Captivity, and all ſuch as had ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated themſelves unto them, from the filthineſſe of the Heathen of the Land to ſeek the Lord God of Iſrael, did eat.</hi> Had not the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:168215:162"/> Prieſts and Levites been thus purified, and the people thus ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, the Paſſeover it appeares had been longer delayed. As theſe ſaw neceſſitating occaſion for omiſſion of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which yet is not charged as their ſin; ſo may alſo the Miniſters of Chriſt ſee like occaſion for delay of adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords Supper. And there is advantage on their part, ſeeing there was a preſcript time in the Law for the obſervation of the one, but no limited time in the Goſpel for the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the other. Sometimes a Miniſter by providence is caſt upon ſuch a people, that ſcarce three are able to diſcern what they have in hand, when they are about this duty, and therefore he ſees no more reaſon to call them to it, then Chriſt ſaw to call his diſciples newly choſen unto private faſtings, or the Apoſtle to give meat to babes; edification is their great buſineſſe, their whole buſineſſe; they may ſtay the time that they may admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter it to edification; ſometimes it evidently appeares that the rent is in a way to be made ſo great by their adminiſtration, through the obſervance of ſome working errour upon the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in others, that are ſo principled, that none but high Saints are for this Ordinance, that they ſee danger in proceeding in it. And though I do not doubt, but that it is often forborn out of ſinful neglect, and by truly conſciencious Miniſters, ſometimes out of over-much indulgence of their brethrens weakneſſe, and their own over-rigid principles: yet as I do believe that all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciencious Paſtours, who for ſome ſpace of time forbear, do judge that there is cauſe for ſuch forbearance, ſo I do believe that upon ſome occaſions <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> it may juſtly be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born. And whatſoever exception is taken againſt Arguments drawn from Analogy, as not concluding, of which I need to ſay no more then I have already ſpoken, yet I ſhall conclude, that this which is drawn from the Paſſeover (which is rather from example, then analogy) is cogent. If that of the <hi>London</hi>-Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines in their <hi>Divine Right of Church-Government,</hi> pag. 20, 21. (quoted and approved by Reverend Mr. <hi>Jeanes,</hi> pag. 21. of his Treatiſe) be of weight, <hi>That whatſoever actions were done by Saints recorded in Scripture, upon ſuch grounds as are of morall, perpetual, and common concernment to one perſon as well as to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to one Church as well as to another, theſe actions are obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to all, and a rule to after-generations,</hi> then this Argument; grounded on the example of ſuch actions, is not to be charged
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:168215:162"/> as not concluding; yea, though we had no ſuch Example to lead us, (as perhaps they had none, to be a precedent to them) yet thoſe reaſons which led them, or thoſe that are equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, may lead us likewiſe.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Rule.</hi> There is no preſcript for the time, or frequency of the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords Supper.</note> 
                           <hi>There is no definitive time in the Gospel for obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor any preciſe determinate preſcript for the frequency of the Lords Supper.</hi> But when and how often Chriſtian prudence muſt order, yet being an holy exerciſe, the day which we are to keep holy calls for it, being the Lords Supper, what time ſo meet as the Lords day? The whole community of the faithful being intereſted in it, it is to be obſerved at the time of their publick meetings, which occaſionally may be at other times, but muſt be at that time. And in caſe breaking of bread, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.7. be meant of the Lords Supper, (as moſt affirm, and I will not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) it is out of queſtion. But yet I cannot think that every holy duty is alwaies to be the work of every holy meeting, ſo the word ſhould never be preached, nor prayer publickly made without a Sacrament; I believe there is ſomewhat extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in a Sacrament, comparative to other duties, as there is in a Faſt. And though the Law for the Paſſeover, and day of Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, tye not us to annual obſervations onely of Sacraments, and Faſts, as it tyed the Jewes; yet me thinks it ſpeaks ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more then ordinary in them, and that Faſts and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not to be done in that frequency, as daily addreſſes to God in prayer, and our hearing from God in his Word. And though I ſubſcribe to Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> and others, that the Apoſtles words, <hi>[As often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup]</hi> implyes that it ſhould be often. A Chriſtian ſhould not ſeldome in his life partake of this Ordinance, yet I ſuppoſe it doth allow, if not imply longer intermiſſion then is to be in other duties. The primitive times, perhaps in ſome places at leaſt, made this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance over-common, celebrating it (as is ſaid) every day, in other places every Lords day. Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> who religiouſly pleads for the frequent celebration of it, ſayes, <hi>It is true, that as in other, ſo in this Divine inſtitution, Satan hath done much by his mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious policy to corrupt mens hearts in the obſervation of it. When the Sacrament was adminiſtred often, he brought it into contempt by the commonneſſe of it: Now that it is adminiſtred ſeldome, through ignorance it is thought unneceſſary.</hi> How truly his obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is verified, we ſee in two extreams into which different
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:168215:163"/> parties are run at this preſent time: One part breaking bread almoſt at all their meetings, and make no more of it then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bread, looking after no Miniſter ſet apart for that work, not ſo much as of their own making, any one whom they will call a gifted diſciple (and ſuch with them is every dipt diſciple) is ſet up for it; They act it while ſome walk, ſome talk in their preſence, with leſſe reverence then befits grave perſons at common meals. I fear there was never more rudeneſſe in <hi>Corinth,</hi> then may be ſeen here in Sacramental obſervations. On the other hand, the Sacrament is almoſt forgotten, and looked upon as a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony antiquated, and obſolete; Chriſtian prudence ſhould interpoſe, and diſcern a mean between both. To quicken and put us on againſt this laſt, of which the moſt had need, inſtead of a Book of Canons,<note place="margin">Directions for our guidance about it.</note> or compulſory Lawes. Let us, 1. Affect our ſoules with an ardent love of Chriſt, and then we ſhall not be ſo ſlack in celebration of this memorial of him: We will keep up the memory of an endeared friend, this way Chriſt hath commended to endear his memory to us. If love be ſuch as it ought, we ſhall not deſire that it be ſeldome, if it may be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly often. <hi>Peter</hi> had it three times in charge from Chriſt, to feed his Lambs, to feed his ſheep; how often he muſt preach Chriſt he is not told, that is left to his love; <hi>If thou loveſt me, feed my ſheep.</hi> Love would not let him be ſlothfull. 2. Let us take into conſideration our own neceſſities, of which here we may have ſupplyes, firſt our want of humiliation, and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaking, how ſlight and overly is all our feeling, and ſenſe of ſin? if let alone are we not in danger to grow paſt feeling? which was the caſe of the Heathen, when they had arrived at the greateſt height of wickedneſſe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.19. Here is an hammer for that purpoſe, when once the Law hath diſcovered, by the light that is given, that we have ſinned. No way to this for the aggravation of it. Here we ſee Gods deteſtation of ſin, that would not ſpare it in his onely Son, as he ſpared not the Angels that ſinned, but having no Mediatour to bear it for them, they bore the puniſhment of it in their own perſons; ſo he ſpared not his own Son, when he had taken upon him our ſin. Here we ſee the deſert of ſin in all thoſe torments which Chriſt bore for us. If we would know ſin, and be ſenſible of wrath, ſtudy the Sacrament, the dead ſoul may be here awakened. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, our ſpiritual weakneſſes and wants, which I ſhall ſet out in
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:168215:163"/> Mr. <hi>Pembles</hi> words, <hi>Let them look inward, and ſee how great need they have of many and often confirmations of their faith, renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their repentance, of ſtirring up the graces of God in their ſoules, to adde an edge, an eagerneſſe to all spiritual affections after holineſſe, to get unto themſelves the moſt powerfull provocations unto obedience. Every one that hath grace knowes how frequently the power thereof is impaired by temptations, weakened by wordly diſtractions, even of our lawful employment, and over-maſtered by the force of ſinful luſts, ſo that they muſt needs diſcover a great deal of ignorance in their ſpiritual eſtate, that feel not in their own ſoules a proneneſſe to aſtoniſhment, as well in their ſoules, as in their bodies, at leaſt they bewray intolerable careleſneſſe, that finding the emptineſſe and leanneſſe of their ſoules, yet neglect to repair often to this holy Table, whereon is ſet forth the bread of life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of when they have eaten, their spirit may come again,</hi> 1 Sam. 31.12 <hi>their hearts may be ſtrengthened, their ſoules may be reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, as with marrow and fatneſſe.</hi> Theſe conſiderations may quicken our appetites after this ſpiritual food. And ſuch a meal extraordinary, with the help of our ordinary refreſhments, in hearing, prayer, and meditation, may carry us on more then 40 dayes, towards our heavenly Manſion. That we haſten not too faſt on the other hand, Let us take into conſideration our inabilities for a ſuitable preparation, and fitneſſe for addreſſe to this Ordinance; we have faſted ſo long in courſe, that we have ſcarce known what humiliation of our ſoules in faſting is; yea; ſome would be every day at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Theſe that I have named are the beſt gages, that I know, to regulate us in it, that in over-eager haſte in duties extraordinary, we do not run our ſelves out of breath; nor in over-much ſloth, give our ſelves over to faintneſſe, and leanneſſe.</p>

This is then a ſad and ſaddening reaſon; It lyes upon theſe to take their ſtate and condition into further conſideration, that by the good hand of God it may be better with them. To provoke theſe to further care of their eternal ſtate, I ſhall put to them theſe queſtions:</p>
                        <p>Firſt, What is it that thou doſt reſpective to other duties,<note place="margin">The excuſe of unfitneſſe exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</note> the duty of Prayer? doſt thou pray ever, or never? reſolving to keep back from the Sacrament, doſt thou reſolve wholly to forbear to call on the Name of the Lord? If thou reſolveſt in this way, and periſheſt, thou haſt upon thee the brand of the wicked, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.4. They call not on the Name of the Lord; and the ſentence of the wrath of God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.25. If thou canſt pray with hopes to be heard, thou mayeſt then have hopes to receive the Sacrament, to be accepted; and if ſo qualified, as to be out of hopes in the one, then thou art altogether void of hopes in both. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks much of the danger of an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Communicant, which ſhould awaken all that intend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. And multitude of Scripture-Texts ſpeak the ſame of men that pray in ſuch a condition: What can be worſe then for the Lord to ſay, when they pray, <hi>he will not hear, he will hide his eyes?</hi> Iſa. 1.15. to reproach their praying, by the name of <hi>howling?</hi> Hoſ. 7.14. to account it an <hi>abomination?</hi> Prov. 28.9.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, If it be above thy hopes to ſit down with accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance at the Lords Table, Is it not then as much above thy hopes to ſit down in heavenly places with Chriſt Jeſus? If thy ſtate of ignorance, unbelief, and wickedneſſe keep thee from partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation with viſible Church-members in this Ordinance in the way, how wilt thou be fit to joyn with the Church Triumphant in glory? Thou muſt be made <hi>meet for heaven,</hi> Col. 1.12. if thou come to heaven: and thou art meet to partake of this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, when thou art meet for heaven; unfit for this, unfit for ſalvation.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, If the danger be great to come unworthily, is it any leſſe not to come at all? It is hard to determine of the ſins of deſpiſing, and prophaning the worſhip of the Lord, whether is greater, or leſſer; Judge whether are in better caſe, thoſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.7. or him that is mentioned, ver. 12, 13. and then thou wilt ſee that there remains nothing, but to endeavour to be ſuch a one that may come, otherwiſe
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:168215:165"/> thou periſheſt in coming, and periſheſt in abſenting.</p>
                        <p>Others profeſſe their willingneſſe, and readineſſe to come, in caſe they could have things to their minds when they come: But things being as they are, they are compelled to forbear. Now theſe keep off out of ſeveral principles, which in caſe they be well laid, they may juſtifie their practice; but in caſe they are found erroneous, their way muſt needs be faulty. Theſe are in two extreams.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Want of a wonted Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy may not excuſe.</note>Some would come in caſe the ancient Liturgy were held, and the Book of Common Prayer anciently in uſe in <hi>England</hi> might be obſerved; in the mean time till that be, they do forbear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To this I ſay, It is wonder how ſo much ſtreſſe is laid on this as to invite to the worſhip of God in caſe they may enjoy it, and to perſwade a total neglect, if they want it. Give me leave to deſire of theſe (there being ſo many that harp upon this ſtring) a few things for ſatisfaction, that ſo we may either prevail with them, to hold Communion with us, or elſe that we may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear with them.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, Is not this an honour far above all, that is due to any labour, or compoſure of man, to turn the ſcale in this manner, whether an inſtituted worſhip of God muſt ſtand or fall? An humane work it is, this cannot be denyed; we are to receive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as Divinely inſpired, upon pain of adding to the Word of God, but that which is contained in the words of the Scripture. For this, ſo to ſteer my courſe, that when my liberty of uſe of it is granted, I will worſhip; and when denyed, I will forbear; This I ſay is too high an honour, a work of man is thus made of the very eſſence and being of an Ordinancie of God. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> indeed put that honour upon the Altar at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> that he would admit no ſacrifice elſewhere, (as <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> could obſerve to his reproach, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37.7.) But he had a Word of God for it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.5, 6. To give the like honour to this book without a word from God, is to idolize it; Theſe opinions of it, were that which outed it.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Is it for the excellency of the work it ſelf, that thou thus prizeſt it? or from the Sanction, that from higher powers hath been put upon it, the Law that did eſtabliſh it? It muſt needs be one of theſe, that moves thee to put ſuch an honour upon it. That no ſuch incomparable tranſcendent excelleny, to cauſe ſo high a price to be put upon it, can be found in the work
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:168215:165"/> it ſelf, may ſeem ſeveral waies to appear, if we conſider, 1. The time of compoſure, immediately upon the firſt dawning of the Goſpel light, and beginning of the knowledg of God in the midſt of us. 2. The perſons for whoſe uſe it was compoſed, ſuch that for the generality had ſcarce ſtept one foot out of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh blindneſſe. 3. The end at which the compilers aimed, to frame ſuch a piece that might draw on a people wholly held in Maſſe Idolatry, to be content to accept ſomewhat in their own tongue, where prayers are directed to God in Chriſt, and not (as before they had been trayned) to Saints, and Angells; So that they made not that uſe of their own gifts for ſuch a work, as by the light received from God they might have framed, but ſuch a one that they judged moſt meet for the Churches preſent infant condition, and ſo contented themſelves, in a great part, with that which they found in the <hi>Breviaries,</hi> and <hi>Portuiſes</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> In ſo much that B. <hi>Davenant</hi> one of the graveſt and moſt learned of Prelates, ſaith, Deter. 37.<note n="k" place="margin">Quidam ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipſis Pontifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Romanis, formulam il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam ſacrorum officiorum qua not utimur, probare volue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, modo nos ab ejus autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate hac in re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pendere volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſemus.</note> that <hi>ſome of the Biſhops of Rome have offered to approve our form of prayers, provided that we would accept it by their authority.</hi> This is ſufficient, if no more ſhould be ſaid, to make it appear that it did never come up to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, that one might reach, that were compoſed in greater light, and for their uſe that were of further growth. But letting it paſſe without exception, and yielding (as muſt be granted) that thouſands are in heaven that received the Sacraments no otherwiſe then according to the directory in it, yet doubtleſſe, as muſt alſo be granted, that many more thouſands are in heaven, that never knew it, Chriſt and his Apoſtles never uſed it. It was not in uſe in the primitive times; How many <hi>Liturgies</hi> may be read, as we may ſee if we go no further then <hi>Caſſander?</hi> and this of ours is none of them. None of the reformed Churches in the world except <hi>England</hi> hath made uſe of it. Had it been of ſuch a glory that men would deny themſelves the benefit of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, rather then want it, all ſhould at the greateſt coſt have procured it. As our forefathers in <hi>England</hi> ſent over into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> for Bibles, at leaſt New Teſtaments with hazard of their lives, ſo ſhould they out of <hi>Germany</hi> have ſent for ourt <hi>Liturgy</hi> Whereas ſome ignorantly ſay, that that was the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <hi>Proteſtaniſme</hi> lives and dies with it; This is damnably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to all Proteſtants in all the world, but our ſelves; The want of this <hi>Liturgy</hi> ſtrikes them out of our Communion; It on
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:168215:166"/> the other hand as much gratifies the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries whiſper this into ignorant eares; they uſe to charge us, that <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth brought in our Religion, but according to theſe we are not ſo old, <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth muſt be the father of it. It is not then from the excellency of the work that men can warrantably refuſe this ordinance of God, upon the want of it the Sacrament may ſtand in its glory without it. But it is from the ſanction that is put upon it, the law that hath eſtabliſhed it, to which the people of <hi>England,</hi> though not others, muſt be ſubject. This many learned in the lawes much queſtioned; while it was moſt in uſe with us upon grounds not eaſily anſwered; the act that impoſed it under ſo ſtrict penalties, referres to the book authorized by Parliament in the fifth, and ſixth years of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, with two onely alterations; now the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from time have been many more, and therefore the book is not the ſame. And whereas we ſhould have recourſe to the ſtandard, the original draught among Parliament-records, that for many yeares hath not been found. 2. When we have ſuffered ſo great a change, as we ſee in our lawes, divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſo ordering, and yet keep ſilence, and in ſubmiſſion to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine will, conform to that which is in preſent; How is it that this ſhould be as the lawes of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> which changeth not? When it is taken from us, we muſt not leave an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, to keep hold of it.</p>
                        <p>Others would receive it, in caſe they might keep up their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted geſture when they come to it.<note place="margin">Variation from a geſture or poſture may not excuſe.</note> But ſeeing that that in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places is not born, therefore they keep from it. <hi>Anſw.</hi> When ſome heretofore did forbear the Sacrament upon the account of kneeling, being ſo prejudiced againſt it (as no Scripture-poſture) that they durſt not uſe it, what clamours and invectives were raiſed againſt them, that they left (as was wont to be objected) a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry duty for that which was arbitrary and indifferent, and upon ſo ſmal an account made a breach of that unity, which ought to be among the people of God? Was it not an uſual language in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of theſe, to ſay that they would receive it lying along; if it were poſſible ſtanding on their heads, rather then want it? and when theſe made it their complaint, that they were accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſchiſmatique Puritans, and worſe then Idolaters, for not kneeling at the Sacrament, Abridg. pag. 39. <hi>Bradſh.</hi> arg. 11. He that took moſt paines, and wrote moſt largely in defence of
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:168215:166"/> kneeling, anſwers, <hi>As for the imputations of Puritanes and Schiſmatiques, ſo far forth as the ſame be caſt upon you for refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to kneel, it is becauſe you refuſe and oppoſe the Church in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter indifferent. For to ſtrive againſt a National Church, and break the peace of it unjuſtly (as to breake it about ſuch mutable geſtures in Gods worſhip, as are truely indifferent both in nature and uſe, is to break them unjuſtly) was ever held for a Schiſmatical courſe. Paybody</hi> of kneeling, part 3. pag. 226. That which was then ſo blame-worthy, that men upon it were ſcarce judged fit to live in the Nation, is it now ſo innocent, and praiſe-worthy? will this be a good plea at the day of judgement, to ſpeak to God in this language? Thou haſt commanded the celebration of thy Supper, enjoyning us to take, eat, and to drink of it. Thou didſt annex a promiſe of the body and blood of Chriſt for the pardon of ſin; now there is a geſture which I would take in, which thou commandeſt not; in caſe I may not have my will in the one, why ſhouldſt thou have thy will in the other? Let thy great promiſe go, rather then I will take and eat it, in any other poſture then that which I have uſed. When ſo many and great troubles were in the Church about this geſture, which are not yet forgotten, many pious men yielded to it, though they ſaw inconvenience in it (ſeeing they durſt not make a ſchiſme in the Church, or be at the loſſe of a Sacrament) but were farre from believing any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of it, or in it. The party that urged it had never more to ſay then the command of authority, to put an obediential, not an inherent neceſſity upon it, (as Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> diſtinguiſhes) and the indifferency of it in its own nature to warrant it; If a geſture (which ſome have judged ſinful, and all have confeſt to be unneceſſary) now be waved, none ſhould be ſo much offended.</p>
                        <p>Others yet would break through all of this,<note place="margin">A call by Church-offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers for an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith is no warranty for abſence.</note> to come to this ordinance, neither want of <hi>Liturgy,</hi> nor change of geſture ſhould keep them back. But there is a further barre in their way, that which <hi>Peter</hi> requires of every man, to be <hi>ready alwaies to give an anſwer to every man that asketh them, a reaſon of the hope that is in them,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.15. is now called for, in caſe they will communicate. Here is their grievance, and therefore they will abſent themſelves, and here is a double exception. 1. The thing it ſelf. 2. The manner of proceeding. As to the thing it ſelf; It is objected, that the Apoſtle ſaies, <hi>Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of his bread, and drink of this Cup, &amp;c.</hi>
                           <pb n="312" facs="tcp:168215:167"/> Every man then is to be left to his own private examination, and not to ſubject himſelf to the examination of another. For an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this grievance, I ſay,</p>
                        <p>Firſt, In caſe that this examination, or account taken, did ſhoulder out that of ſelf examination, the objection were then to purpoſe; if theſe can be proved oppoſite, and not ſubordinate, one of them muſt then be waved.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Let us then agree in this, that ſelf examination is neceſſary: and that it is to be done in order to the worthy receiving the Lords Supper; and all that would communicate, to be ready to engage themſelves for this ſelf-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nrtion, and then I ſhall onely demand theſe queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, Whether they will examine themſelves, or engage for examination, that cannot examine? Whether they will make a ſearch, that have not eies to ſee? Whether they will prove themſelves, whether they be in the faith, that know not faith? Whether they will examine their humiliation under ſin, and return from ſin, that know not ſin? If a Miniſter of Chriſt ſhould call upon his people to examine, before they eat of this bread, or drink of this cup, he muſt upon that account take care that they be ſo farre knowing as to do it. If he muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter it for edification, he ſhould ſee (ſo farre as he is able to diſcern) whether they be in a capacity to be edified by it. If this knowledg be wanting, then by their own confeſſion they are unmeet, in caſe they be of knowledg, it is eaſily ſignified, and made known, eſpecially fundamental neceſſary principles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone demanded.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Among other graces, wilt not thou in this ſelf-exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination look for that grace of humility? that of hungring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt Jeſus evidenced in the love of his Ordinances? If thou art wholly wanting in the grace of humility, thou ſtandeſt unfit for this Table, <hi>God reſiſts the proud, The ſoul that is lift up is not right.</hi> If once this be obtained, then thou wilt, as to thy guidance in heaven-way, not be too high to obey thoſe that are over thee in the Lord. Thoſe ſpeeches that we have heard of ſcorn and compariſons entred, never came from an humble heart. If thou wanteſt an hungring fervent affection after Chriſt Jeſus, thou then art not meet for this Table, as being without a ſpiritual appetite; If thou haſt attained to it, no ſuch
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:168215:167"/> barres will be pleaded, or ſpoken of to hold thee from it. Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger will break ſtone-walls, iron-bars: This is a hard weapon that will break through all obſtacles.</p>
                        <p>For the manner, ſome ſay,<note place="margin">The aſſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Elders in the work, no warranty for abſence.</note> If this were done by the Miniſter alone, they could eaſily bear, but others aſſociated they do not like. Ruling Lay-Elders they ſuppoſe are not of Gods inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To this I ſay,</p>
                        <p>Firſt, What do they ſay to all the Reformed Churches almoſt in the World, that have that way of Diſcipline; if thou wert a member of the Church there, wouldeſt thou upon this account ſeparate and leave Church-Communion?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, What ſayeſt thou of our Government in this Church, when Biſhops were in power; who acted then in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment but <hi>Chancellors,</hi> and <hi>Officials,</hi> who were for the moſt part lay-perſons? If ſuch could rule over a whole County, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps three or four Counties; three or four may then with the Miniſter have inſpection into one Pariſh. The 26 Canon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Miniſters to keep back notorious offenders from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; and Canon 27. provided that he ſhould give his reaſon upon complaint to the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> and obey his direction. This <hi>Ordinary</hi> was for the moſt part a Lay-perſon, and he was ſet over both the Miniſters and Communicants of many Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, In caſe any judge that according to Goſpel-order, no others ſhould joyn with the Miniſter, but that he ſhould act alone in admiſſion; what prejudice is this to the Sacrament, when he that is confeſſedly called to the work, acts alone in the adminiſtration of it? And in caſe a Miniſter ſee it expedient to crave aſſiſtance in ſo weighty a buſineſſe, eſpecially where he is caſt upon a large Congregation, for his further information, and advice; where then is the evill? When Miniſters this way go alone, then it is auricular confeſſion, ſhrift, and whatſoever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe can deviſe; then partiality is objected, that out of ſpleen they put men from this Ordinance; when to avoid theſe even by conſent help is choſen, that on the other hand it is ſuch a grievance,<note place="margin">The mixture of ſuch that are ſuppoſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, no warrantly for abſence.</note> that it is thought a ſufficient reaſon of mens ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
                        <p>Theſe that we have hitherto ſeen are extreams on the one hand. There are thoſe of an oppoſite party, that have their Objections likewiſe, and would come, as they ſay, to this Table,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:168215:168"/> in caſe they could meet with ſuitable gueſts there, and thoſe onely that become ſuch a Feaſt; ſuch that are holy, and no other; but looking for others there whom God never called, they reſolve upon that account to keep abſent. I anſwer, 1. Let theſe take heed leſt they take too much upon them, in paſſing ſentence upon all that come to joyn in this duty, and think bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon it, whether that, or ſomewhat elſe, ought not to be there their buſineſſe? 2. Whether they go not higher then the Word of God will bear them out in the principles that they lay for the qualification of ſuch a one that is admittible to this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? and take heed that their great ambition be not to find out a Church in that purity and glory, that Chriſt hath altogether denyed to be enjoyed on earth. 3. Where it is that they can have hopes to go to joyn, where all give evidences of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and no other are received? Theſe betake themſelves all their dayes to the Society of Seekers. As thoſe under the famine of the Word threatened by the Prophet, ſhall <hi>wander from Sea to Sea, and from the North, even to the Eaſt, and ſhall run to and fro, ſeeking the Word of the Lord:</hi> So may theſe, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Church of their own fancying, but ſhall find none. But for more full ſatisfaction, let theſe take theſe following Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments into conſideration.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Arguments evincing the lawfulneſſe of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in mixt Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note>Firſt, There is never an approved example in all the Scripture, of any one man that did ſeparate, or withdraw himſelf from an Ordinance, which God hath enjoyned upon the account of the impurity or defilement, either of him that did adminiſter, or of thoſe that were to joyn in it. It is true that it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.17. as the aggravation of the ſin of <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas</hi> the ſons of <hi>Eli,</hi> that men then (and as appears for their ſakes) abhorred the offering of the Lord, and therefore in all probability abſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves from it; but <hi>Elkanah</hi> and <hi>Hannah</hi> did not ſo, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, Chap. 1.3, 7. and Mr. <hi>Hilderſam.</hi> Lect. 29 on <hi>John,</hi> pag. 129. obſerves from Chap. 2.24. that it was their ſin that made any ſuch ſeparation.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, There are many approved Examples of the people of God to the contrary; how much do we read in the Prophets of the peoples wickedneſſe, and corruptions in the State Civill, and Eccleſiaſtical? yet which of them for that cauſe did make ſeparation? We ſee what company did reſort to the houſe of God in <hi>Jeremy</hi>'s time. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.9, 10. and yet we ſee <hi>Jeremy</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:168215:168"/> when he had liberty, to reſort to it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 36.5. Much was out of frame, and little in due order in Chriſts time; yet as he acknowledged, that even then <hi>ſalvation was of the Jewes,</hi> Joh. 4.22. they had then ſaving Ordinances among them, ſo he held Communion with them, as he religiouſly obſerved other Feaſts, ſo ſome have obſerved (as we have heard) that he kept four Paſſeovers, after he appeared in publick, for the work of mans Redemption.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, One mans ſin muſt not keep another from a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry enjoyned duty; if one man will make himſelf by his prophane addreſſes guilty of Chriſts death, another muſt not therefore forbear to ſhew forth his death. This is ſuch a duty, and the ſin of another will by no means excuſe neglect of it: this were to ſin, becauſe another ſins; to deſpiſe an Ordinance, becauſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other prophanes it: when one came without a wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no invited gueſt for his ſake did keep from the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, No one Communicant is bound to examine what all are, that are his fellow-Communicants; there is neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe command for it, nor yet reaſon to evince it; each man is bound to ſee himſelf arrayed, as he ought, and not to find fault in others addreſſes, <hi>Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat;</hi> though he be to admoniſh as his brothers viſible ſin gives him occaſion.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, The penalty of him that comes unworthily, reaches his own ſelf, that comes in his unworthineſſe, and extends no further. Legal uncleanneſſe defiled the man, that was perſonally unclean, and not his neighbour: ſo it is here, <hi>He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himſelf,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, If one mans ſin this way do defile another, the ſin of one Communicant doth defile all other Communicants; then it muſt be either from the nature of ſin, thus to defile all in ſo near Communion, or from the nature of the Ordinance thus to be defiled to all, when one in defilement comes to it; or from ſome poſitive precept forbidding all to come, when any that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean is there. I doubt not but this is a ſufficient enumeration. But, 1. It is not of the nature of ſin, thus to defile all, in ſuch communion, then it would every where thus defile, whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any have ſociety, or do accompany together. Then the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:168215:169"/> chief Prieſts had done well, to keep out of the Judgment-Hall, that they might be clean, to keep the Paſſeover, <hi>John</hi> 18.28. and the Phariſees to waſh, when they came from Market. 2. It is not of the nature of the Ordinance to be thus defiled to all. It is not ſo in other Ordinances: <hi>Cain</hi>'s offering defiled not <hi>Abels,</hi> nor did <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas</hi> in their offerings defile <hi>Elkanah</hi> and <hi>Hannah</hi> when they offered. 3. Nor yet is there any poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive precept, forbidding a cleanſed ſoul, upon the account of the uncleanneſſe of another, to come to this Table.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, If one mans preſence in this way defile another, then it is either his ſimple preſence, ſuch a ones being there in his infection, or elſe a willing and witting preſence with ſuch a one. If ſimple preſence do defile, then there is no man that can be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure. The cloſeſt hypocrite that creeps in unawares would be the undoing of all; when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Ye are clean, but not all,</hi> Joh 13.10. according to this opinion it had been a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the uncleanneſſe of one had been the defilement of all. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it willing, or witting preſence, that can in this way defile, then it muſt be in every ſingle mans power to determine him to be ſuch, and exclude him thence, or elſe of neceſſity exclude himſelf. When the Elderſhip hath judged and received accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the general way of Reformed Churches, or the plurality of votes of believers, as it is with men of the Congregational way, he muſt make an after-ſearch, a further ſcrutiny; he that one judges fit, that moſt judge fit, ſome will judge unworthy, and upon that account muſt ſhut themſelves out of Communion. Men of ſuch principles muſt everlaſtingly avoid all Church-fellowſhip, or act againſt their principles; and we need not to ſpeak it, it is too plainly viſible what manner of perſons men of ſuch high pretences have in their Congregations. There are multitudes of Arguments heaped to nouriſh this ſcruple, but I ſhall not further trouble the Reader; there is nothing, I think, can be ſaid, but that which here hath been ſpoke, will afford a ſufficient anſwer.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> The being of Sacraments depends upon their uſe.</head>
                     <p>Another Poſition yet followes from the words,
<q>The being of Sacraments depends upon their uſe, they are no Sacraments to thoſe that do not partake of them.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is grounded upon this act of <hi>Abraham</hi> appointed of God, and accordingly done by him,<note place="margin">The being of Sacraments conſiſts in their uſe.</note> 
                        <hi>He received the ſign of Circumciſion.</hi> All that he did was in obedience of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Commandment, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.11. <hi>And ye ſhall circumciſe the fleſh of your foreskin, and it ſhall be a token of the Covenant betwixt me and you.</hi> It was not the foreskin, but the foreskin cut off, that was the token of the Covenant. So alſo in that of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, <hi>Iſrael</hi> had a command from God, <hi>to take every man a lamb, and to eat the fleſh roſt with fire, and unleavened bread, and with bitter herbs ye ſhall eat it,</hi> Exod. 12.3, 8. It is not barely the Lamb, but eaten in the way that God preſcribed, that made the Sacrament. In Baptiſme, the command is, <hi>Baptize them in the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> It is not water that makes up Baptiſme, but water applyed to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, or the ſubject to the water. In the Lords Supper there is bread and wine in their ſignificancy held out, not for bare ſight, but a Command is added; <hi>Take, eat, drink ye all of this;</hi> bread and wine makes not up the Sacrament, without breaking, giving, taking, and eating. In thoſe Sacraments extraordinary. The Sea was no Sacrament, but <hi>Iſraels</hi> paſſage through it. The Cloud was no Sacrament, but <hi>Iſraels</hi> guidance by it, or the cloud guiding <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> following after it. Neither was the Manna a Sacrament, or the rock conſidered in themſelves; but the Manna eaten, the water of the rock drunk by the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> Even the fictious Sacraments of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> conſiſt in their uſe: Their <hi>Order</hi> is no Sacrament, where there is none Ordained; and <hi>Marriage</hi> is no Sacrament, where none are married. Their <hi>Chriſme</hi> in confirmation, <hi>oyl</hi> in extream uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not applyed, are of no uſe, or efficacy. This is plain in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.<note place="margin">Arguments to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>vince it.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, The being of Sacraments depends on their inſtitution;
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:168215:170"/> Take away their inſtitution, and they have no being at all. But the inſtitution leads us not barely to an element, but preſcribes the uſe; not onely to a ſign, but the application of it; not onely to water, but to be baptized with water; not onely to bread and wine, but the eating of bread, drinking of wine, and the beholding of both.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the being of Sacraments depends upon the relation of the ſign to the thing ſignified, with the analogy and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is held between them. This is plain; Take away ſuch relation, and the element is a common element, and not a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſet aſide, the conſideration of the blood, and Spirit of Chriſt, and water is an element for common uſe, to take away the filth of the fleſh, but for removal neither of the guilt, nor filth of ſin. Take away the conſideration of the body and blood of Chriſt, and bread may ſtrengthen nature, but not nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh the ſoul. But the relation is not barely in the ſigns, or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but in their applications to the ſubject; water beares no relation to the cleanſing of ſin, but waſhing with water; and bread and wine, no relation to the ſetting forth of the Lords death, remembrance of him, or life by him, but the breaking, eating, and drinking.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That which being removed nulls a Sacrament, that is neceſſary to the being of Sacraments. This is plain; Nothing can deſtroy being, but the want of that which is neceſſary to being: But the removal, or taking away of the uſe nulls and deſtroyes the bring of Sacraments. Let not the foreskin be cut off, nor the Lamb roſted, and eaten; the water not be applyed to the perſon, nor bread and wine eaten and drunken, there is no Sacrament; therefore the uſe of Sacraments gives being to them.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, All benefit of, and in the thing ſignified, conſiſts in the application, therefore the Sacraments for their being, uſe, and benefit, conſiſt in their application likewiſe. The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is grounded upon the analogy that is between the ſign and the thing ſignified. The antecedent is clear, the blood of Chriſt, the ſufferings of Chriſt not brought home to the ſoul, and intereſt obtained by application, doth not benefit, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, That which enters the definition of a Sacrament, is of the being of it. This none can deny: But the uſe or office of a
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:168215:170"/> Sacrament enters the definition of it: <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines it to be a ſign and ſeal, which plainly ſpeaks not the nature, but the uſe of Sacramental elements.</p>
                     <p>Here is no Conroverſie in this thing among parties, ſave with the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> neither is there any with them, ſave in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper. They confeſſe that the being of Baptiſme doth ſo conſiſt in the uſe, that without it, it is no Sacrament. Onely the Lords Supper (for Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſake) though never uſed, is ſtill a Sacrament, when they reſerve it in a box, carry it about for pomp, hold it up for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, it is ſtill a Sacrament. The body of Chriſt is ſtill there, and if a mouſe falls upon it, the mouſe receives a Sacrament, knawes upon Chriſts fleſh. But when worms breed in it (as they may by their own confeſſion) they are hard put to it. They cannot breed upon accidents, the ſhape, the colour of bread cannot give being to worms. And to ſay that the ſubſtance which remains there, which is the fleſh of Chriſt, breeds them, is no low blaſphemy. The generation of one is the corruption of another, and God <hi>will not ſuffer his holy One to ſee corruption.</hi> I remember an anſwer to this great difficulty, (when I firſt read Philoſophy) out of <hi>Conimbricenſes</hi> Phyſicks; That learned Society did determine, that God by miracle did create matter, and laid it by the conſecrate hoſt, and that did putrifie, and not the conſecrated bread, and ſo Worms were generated. They ſure believe that it is an eaſie thing to put God upon miracles. Againſt this permanency of this Sacrament out of the uſe of it, we ſay,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, If the uſe of this be inſtituted,<note place="margin">The Sacrament of the Lords Supper equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tranſient with Baptiſme.</note> as well as the uſe of Baptiſme, and given in command; then this Sacrament conſiſts in the uſe, as well as Baptiſme. This cannot be denyed, for the inſtitution, and Comman of Chriſt muſt equally lead us in both. But in the Lords Supper, as well as in Baptiſme, the uſe is within the inſtitution, and given in Command by Chriſt; Therefore this Sacrament of the Lords Supper conſiſts in the uſe, as well as that of Baptiſme. Whereas <hi>Bellarmine</hi> replyes to this, that Chriſt commanded the bread to be eaten, but not preſently after conſecration; therefore to delay eating is not againſt the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. To this we anſwer, 1. Neither did he command water, as ſoon as ſet apart for Baptiſme, to be applyed to the party to be baptized; yet till it be applyed, the party is not baptized, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:168215:171"/> is no Sacrament; and ſo the bread and wine in that interim ſtill applyed, ſtill wants the nature of a Sacrament. 2. He did command it then to be eaten, by <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s confeſſion, though not inſtantly to be eaten; and he gave the like command of the cup, as of the bread, yea, with more exactneſſe a note of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality added, <hi>Drink ye all of it;</hi> yet their Laity have a Sacrament, and never drink of it. 3. That which the Apoſtles did, that Chriſt enjoyned (as <hi>Ameſius</hi> well replyes;) they underſtood Chriſts intimation, as well as the moſt nimble-headed Jeſuites, but they did not reſerve it, but did eat it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If there be no footſteps in all the holy Scriptures, of any other way of dealing with the elements of the Lords Supper, then the eating and drinking of them; then, according to the inſtitution, they muſt be eaten, and drunken: But there is no footſtep there, of any other dealing with the Sacrament, then eating and drinking; Therefore according to the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it is not to be reſerved, but to be eaten and drunk. Indeed <hi>Chamier</hi> quotes <hi>Croquet</hi> replying, that ſome of the Ancient have ſaid, that <hi>Judas</hi> took one part of the Sacrament, and reſerved the other for ſcorn; but this may be well reckoned among others of like nature in their Legends. And I would adviſe all thoſe that believe it, if they be ambitious to be diſciples of <hi>Judas,</hi> to follow it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The promiſe in this Sacrament is not to be divided from the precept, by any that will expect a bleſſing. But where the promiſe is, <hi>This is my body, this is my blood in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> in the inſtitution, There is a precept, <hi>Take, eat, Drinke ye all of this;</hi> therefore they muſt eat, and drink, that will have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit in the promiſe. It would little I ſuppoſe pleaſe the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to hear <hi>Bellarmine, Suarez,</hi> and other Jeſuits to exempt this Sacrament from the common nature of Sacraments, and to make it permanent, when the other (as they ſpeak) are tranſeunt. <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> Part 3. Quaeſt. 73. art. 1. reſp. ad. 3. makes this difference between the Euchariſt and other Sacraments, <hi>This Sacrament is perfected</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the conſecration of the matter, other Sacraments are perfected in the application of the matter to the perſon to be ſanctified. Suarez,</hi> diſp. 42. Sect. 4. quotes it with approbation; and <hi>Scotus in quanto</hi> Diſt. 8. quaeſt. 1. as he is quoted by <hi>Ameſius, All the Sacraments except the Euchariſt conſiſt in their uſe;</hi> ſo that in them the Sacrament, and the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:168215:171"/> of the Sacrament is the ſame. He that pleaſes may read <hi>Bellar.</hi> Arguments, lib. 4. <hi>de Euchariſtia,</hi> Cap. 2, 3, 4. <hi>Suarez</hi> in the place named with <hi>Whitakers, Ameſius, Vorſtius</hi> in 3. Tom. <hi>Bellar.</hi> Theſ. 9. pag. 406. <hi>Chamier</hi> againſt them both, with others of that party, <hi>de Euchariſtia,</hi> lib. 7. cap. 4, &amp;c. I ſhall deſire to take up the Reader with that which I judge more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; <hi>Gerard</hi> in his Common places, Cap. 4. <hi>de Sacramentis,</hi> makes it his buſineſſe to find out the <hi>Genus</hi> in the definition of a Sacrament, in which the general form of Sacraments, he ſayes, is to be included; and concludes, 1. In the negative, that it is not to be defined a ſign, and in the affirmative, that it is an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Though this perhaps might rather have been taken into conſideration when we ſpake of Sacramental ſignes, and laid open that part of the definition, yet being ſlipt there, it may not inconveniently be ſpoken to in this place. In this determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his, he ſuppoſeth, he meeteth with a double error; One, of the Papiſts, but now examined, that the Euchariſt is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent thing, and not tranſient; which it cannot be, in caſe it be an action. And the other both of Papiſts, and the followers of <hi>Calvin,</hi> (as he calls them) both of which affirm, that it is a ſign, and that muſt ſupply the place of the <hi>genus</hi> in the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and though he profeſſes willingly to yeeld, that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be called ſignes, in reſpect of their office, and end; yet he will not have it put into the definition, forgetting it ſeems (for he doth not once take notice of it) that the Apoſtle in the Text ſo defines it. His Reaſons to conclude, that Sacraments are not to be defined, as ſignes are:<note n="1. a" place="margin">Aliud eſt res ipſa, aliud ejus offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium ac finis, aliud appellatio ejus ex officio, aliud definitio ex eſſentia. Definitio eſt <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. Ergo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus in definitione peti debet ex rei definitae eſſentiâ; jam vero eſſe ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num non pertinet ad quidditatem, ſed ad ejus finem &amp; uſum.</note> 
                        <hi>A thing it ſelf is one, and the end, and office is another. The appellation of it by the office is one, and the definition by the eſſence is another: Now to be ſignes, and ſeales, is the end and office of Sacraments.</hi> To which I anſwer; That Sacrament denoteth the office and uſe for which ſuch and ſuch an element, according to Divine appointment, ſerves. If we ſhould go about to define bread or water (which are appointed to be ſignes) to be ſignes and ſeales, we ſhould run upon a great errour. For it is neither of the eſſence of bread, nor wine to be a ſign. But defining a Sacrament in that way, we hold forth the very eſſence of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="322" facs="tcp:168215:172"/>2. He ſaies<note n="b" place="margin">2. Definitio debet conſtare ex prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus &amp; notioribus; Sacramenta eſſe ſigna &amp; ſigilla ex prioribus &amp; notiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, quia ipſorum cognitio pendet ex actionibus &amp; ceremioniis, hae enim cum fine, qui eſt ſignare, conjunctae, dicuntur ſigna &amp; ſigilla</note> 
                        <hi>The definition ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of that which is before, and better known then the thing defined; But ſignes and ſeales are not before, and better known then Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> The minor which every one will be ready to deny, he proves, <hi>Becauſe the knowledg of them depends on actions and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi> as though the Elements alone were ſignes without conſideration of the actions which in the inſtitution are enjoyned. His third reaſon is, becauſe<note n="c" place="margin">3. Proprium genus debet eſſe propin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quum; ſignum autem eſt genus Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti remotum, tum quia à fine peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta eſt haec denominatio, tum quia mediantibus actionibus certo verbo &amp; externo elemento conſtantibus ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> 
                        <hi>to be a ſigne is not the immediate, but the remote genus of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which he proves in that <hi>it is no ſign oterwiſe then by reaſon of actions accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Where we meet with the ſame miſtake as before. If it be by the help of actions that they are ſignes, it is then by help of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, Elements with their actions and not otherwiſe are ſignes. 4. He ſaies,<note n="d" place="margin">4. Pars rei non eſt genus rei ut totius; ſigna in oculos incurrentia ſunt pars Sacramentorum, una terrena ſcilicet, cui adjuncta res coeleſtis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibilis Sacra mentum proprie dictum conſtituit.</note> 
                        <hi>One part of a thing is not the genus of it, as whole: But ſigns are but part of a Sacrament, There being two parts, one terrene, and the other heavenly; and therefore it is not the genus.</hi> To which I reply, 1. The action which he puts into the definition is but one part ſure, and the earthly part, whether it be the action of the diſpenſer, or receiver, that he underſtands by action. 2. It ſeems that he would have a definition of an outward Element, and Chriſt put into one notion together. 3. We define that which lies upon our hand by divine inſtitution, which is the office of ſuch, and ſuch Elements with the actions about them, leading to the thing ſignified. Laſtly, He ſaith<note n="e" place="margin">5. Genus non debet eſſe am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguum; at qui vox ſigni eſt ambigua, &amp;c.</note> 
                        <hi>that the genus in a definition must not be ambiguous: But this is ambiguous, for men ſpeak of ſignes ambiguouſly.</hi> But this is nothing to thoſe that ſpeak di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly of ſignes, when they put them into a definition, and make it to appear what ſignes they mean; So that the Apoſtles defini-nition making Sacraments ſignes, is yet uncontroulable. And defence being made that they are rightly defined to be ſignes, all that is ſaid to prove that action is to be the <hi>genus,</hi> may eaſily be anſwered.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The author by an induction proves, that <hi>actions are enjoyned in all Sacraments,</hi> which we eaſily yield, and as eaſily prove that
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:168215:172"/> thoſe are ſignificant actions, and ſo make up the ſign, and that they are Sacramentall, not <hi>quâ</hi> actions, for then as often as we eat bread, or drink wine, we ſhould be at a Sacrament; and as often as a woman puts water upon her childs face, ſhe ſhould be about baptiſme.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Sacraments</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are actions; Circumciſion is an action, ſo the Paſchal Lamb, Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper. The firſt is the cutting off the foreskin; the ſecond is the roſting, and eating of a Lamb; the third is dipping or ſprinkling with water, and the fourth eating and drinking bread and wine.</hi> Anſw. 1. And all theſe are ſignificant actions in and about an outward element, and ſo we are where we were. 2. Theſe inſtances are no proofes that Sacraments are actions, but that action is required to the making up of a Sacrament. It is not ſimply action, but an action with reſtraint to ſuch an Element, in, and about ſuch a ſubject; Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion in any other part could have been no Sacrament, nor yet eating of any other creature in the time of the law then a Lamb of the flock, or of the herd; nor yet any other ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drinking of bread and wine, then in the manner preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. And ſo we may ſay of dipping, pouring, or ſprinkling 3. He does not tell us, whether it be the diſpenſers action, or the receivers, that makes a Sacrament. In Circumciſion, and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme he ſpeakes nothing of any action in the receiver. In the Paſſeover and Lords Supper he ſaies nothing of any action of the diſpenſer. And it is for the receivers ſake that the Sacrament is appointed, and <hi>Iſaacs</hi> Circumciſion, and every infants Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme (if not <hi>Abrahams</hi> Circumciſion, and Baptiſme of men of years) may rather be defined by paſſion then action. And paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion may as well challenge the ſeat of Sacraments, as action, where he placeth it. He concludes, <hi>that ancient and modern Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, yea,</hi> Calvins <hi>followers call them by the name of rites, and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which we know to conſist in action.</hi> Here is a manifeſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, rites and Ceremonies are not alwaies actions, neither hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, nor divine Ceremonies. The high Prieſts Ephod, with the reſt of thoſe holy garments preſcribed, were Ceremonies, and ſo was the ſurplice while in uſe in <hi>England,</hi> and yet theſe were in the predicament of <hi>Habitus</hi> and not of <hi>Actio.</hi> It is true that the putting them on was an action, but that was not the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, but the wearing of them in the work of worſhip, and the putting it on was no act of him that wore it, but his that
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:168215:173"/> waited upon him. And kneeling at the Sacrament was eſteemed a Ceremony with us, yet no action, but a geſture, or poſture of the body, and in the predicament of <hi>Situs,</hi> Dr. <hi>Burges</hi> indeed in his rejoynder defines a Ceremony to be an action, pag. 29. But preſently he explaines himſelf, and ſaies, <hi>I call it an action, becauſe nothing is or can be a Ceremony in reſpect of exiſtence, or being, but onely in reſpect of acting or uſage thereof, as a ceremony:</hi> ſo that he takes action <hi>abuſive,</hi> for any manner of uſage whatſoever; upon the publiſhing of the book, I ſpake with the author of this thing, and he acknowledged action ſtrictly taken, was too narrow to be the <hi>Genus</hi> of a Ceremony, and that it was holpen by the word uſage. So Dr. <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> that renouned Logician, ſpeaking of the execution, done by <hi>Phinehas</hi> in the diviſion of his text, calls his ſtanding up an action, but preſently addes. <hi>Though I call it an action; yet it is a geſture properly, and not an action,</hi> ſo that when rites, and Ceremonies may be poſtures, or habits, it cannot be ſaid that they conſiſt in action; ſo that it is clear, that Sacraments conſiſt in their uſe, and though actions be ſeen in every Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either done by the diſpenſer, or receiver, or both; yet thoſe actions being upon, and about ſome viſible element, and the Elements themſelves, with the actions being all ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant; Sacraments are yet rightly defined to be ſignes, and not actions.</p>
                     <p>Then it muſt neceſſarily follow by way of Corollary, <hi>that there is no holineſſe remaining in the elements,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">There is no continued ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> 
                        <hi>no relative holineſſe abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon them, further then according to the inſtitution they are applyed and received.</hi> The water in the veſſel that containes it is no further (as I may ſay) conſecrate then as it is applyed to the perſon baptized. The river of <hi>Jordan,</hi> nor yet the waters near <hi>Aenon,</hi> in <hi>Salem,</hi> had no more holineſſe then other waters in <hi>Jury.</hi> The reliques of bread and wine in the Lords Supper, have no more of holineſſe, when they are taken from thence then they had when they were brought thither. Tipling off of the wine in the place where it was immediately before received as a Sacrament (of which I have heard) is undecent, and unſuitable to the work that they have been upon, yet it is no other then common wine that then is taken. Care ſhould be taken not to defile the perſon who remaines conſecrate to God, and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of theſe elements makes profeſſion of it, no ſuch fear of prophaning the elements themſelves. But for a great part
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:168215:173"/> theſe are well contented to be prophane, provided that the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be eſteemed, and honoured as holy. This high opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of holineſſe in the conſecrated wine robbed the people of it. Many of the Laity have beards that may lick ſome drops of it up, and the number encreaſing it muſt paſſe through ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hands, or be put to ſo many mouthes, that ſome may be ſpilt; and thoſe fears here ſo wrought, that they may not meddle at all with it. And how great diſputes there have been, what ſhall be done with it, if a weak ſtomack vomit it up while the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of it doth remain unchanged; they that are verſt in Popiſh Caſuiſts well know. And all this from that monſter of Tranſubſtantiation. But when a right uſe of the Sacraments is underſtood, all theſe ſuperſtitious conceits will vaniſh, and come to nothing; when a ſealed indenture hath done its office, we no longer look much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the wax, and parchment.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Their touch or abode upon any thing or utenſil does not make it holy.</note> 
                        <hi>If their Sacramental nature remain no longer then their uſe, ſo that themſelves are no further holy, then their touch, or former abodes cannot make any place, or utenſil holy; it cannot leave any ſuch remaining holineſſe</hi> (as ſome conceit) <hi>behind.</hi> So it would follow that in caſe the words of conſecration be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced over all the bread in the greateſt pantry, or to be ſold in the market place (which men of that opinion ſay may be done) then not onely every bit of that bread is turned into Chriſt, but all the binges or panniers that receive the bread in them muſt have an holineſſe remaining, and abiding upon them, and ſo in like caſe all the Wine in the cellar, yea, all the earth of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> would remain holy by reaſon of the Manna falling upon it, which was ſpiritual meat, therefore a prophaning of it, to tread with the foot upon it, much more for beaſts to dung and graze it. As much is ſaid to prove that the rock was Chriſt, as there is to prove that the cup is Chriſts blood. If that had ſuch a ſanctifying power, then all the ground on which the water ran, yea, every beaſt that drank of it, was made holy. The thought of this might have ſilenced that talk of bowing to the place of Gods ſpecial reſidence, by which they meant the place where the Sacrament hath been celebrated, which of a Table they made an Altar, which then according to our Saviour Chriſt, muſt make holy the body and blood of Chriſt, offered upon it, and the body and blood of Chriſt muſt not make it holy, <hi>Ye fooles, and blind, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is greater, the gift or the altar that ſanctifieth the gift?</hi> Matth.
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:168215:174"/> 23.19. But with us the gift did put the ſanctification upon the Altar, that from the time that the gift had been upon it, men muſt upon ſight ſtill worſhip <hi>ad, verſus, coram,</hi> amazing thoſe that were offended at it, with their diſtinction of inheſive and abſtractive holineſſe.</p>

                        <p>HEre followes a ſecond uſe and office of Sacraments; which being added to the former, makes up the whole for which they ſerve. As they are ſignes, ſo they are ſeales; from whence a double Obſervation followes.</p>
                        <p>Sacraments are ſeales.</p>
                        <p>All that the Sacraments work on the ſoules of receivers is by way of ſign and ſeal.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Sacraments are ſeales.</note>Before this can be proved, by reaſon of the ambiguity of the word, it is to be diſtinguiſhed; <hi>Seal</hi> is ſometimes taken proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that is yet twofold: 1. A ſeal ſealing, or making an impreſſion, and ſo the inſtrument uſed for that purpoſe is called a ſeal, or ſignet; ſo, <hi>Gen.</hi> 38.18. <hi>Judah</hi> delivered to <hi>Tamar</hi> his <hi>ſignet,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Several accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the word.</note> or ſeal; ſo, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.17. 2. A ſeal ſealed, or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an impreſſion; ſo the Letters that we ſend have their ſeales upon them, when we yet keep our ſignet, or ſealing ſeal, to make thouſands of impreſſions: ſo in the viſion, <hi>Revel.</hi> 5.1. there is a book with <hi>ſeven ſeales.</hi> Sometimes the word is uſed Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically. And that is alſo twofold; 1. By way of alluſion to the ſignet, or inſtrument ſealing; and ſo thoſe things that are of great eſteem, and highly prized, are called by the name of ſeales, or ſignets, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 22.24. <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord, Though Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niah the ſon of Jehojakim the King of Judah were the ſignet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence.</hi> So, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.23. 2. By way of alluſion to the uſe and office of a ſignet, or ſeal, as making impreſſion on things ſealed, that is, as doing the office of ſuch ſeales: Here it is taken metaphorically, not in a proper
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:168215:174"/> ſenſe, but in alluſion to the uſe of ſeales, not the ſignet it ſelf.<note place="margin">Several uſes of a ſeal.</note> Now the uſe of ſeales is various.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, For ſecrecy,<note place="margin">For Secrecy.</note> to keep things cloſe, ſo that while the ſeal is upon them none may look into them. To that end we uſe to put ſeales on our Letters, that they may not be read by any but thoſe whom they concern; ſo the chief Prieſts ſealed the ſtone, of Chriſts Sepulcher, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.66. To this uſe of a ſeal the Prophet alludes, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.16. <hi>Bind up the teſtimony, ſeal the Law among the diſciples;</hi> and <hi>John</hi> alſo in that viſion, <hi>Revel.</hi> 5.1. <hi>I ſaw in the right hand of him that ſate on the Throne a book written within, and on the back ſide ſealed with ſeuen ſeales.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, For warranty<note place="margin">For Warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> and authority in the diſcharge of any buſineſſe. <hi>Haman</hi> had <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> his ſeal for the ſlaughter of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> Eſth. 3.12. And <hi>Jezabel</hi> had the ſeal of <hi>Ahab</hi> to bring <hi>Naboth</hi> into queſtion, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.8. and to this uſe of a ſeal the Lord Chriſt alludes, where he vouches the authority of the Son of man to give life to the world, <hi>Him hath God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſealed,</hi> Joh. 6.27.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, For diſtinction,<note place="margin">For Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> or ſeparation, to mark out things that are to be known, and diſtinguiſhed from others. Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities allowed to paſſe, have the publick Officers ſtamp; and the Merchant puts his mark on the wares that he buyes, as the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier on his beaſts, the Shepherd on his flock, to diſtinguiſh them from thoſe that belong to others. To this the Apoſtle alludes, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Having this ſeal, The Lord knoweth them that are his.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly, For ſecurity,<note place="margin">For Security.</note> to keep things inviolable, and free from harm. To that end <hi>Daniels</hi> priſon-door was ſealed, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.17. To this uſe of ſeales <hi>Solomon</hi> alludes, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.12. <hi>A gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den encloſed is my ſiſter, my spouſe, a spring ſhut up, a fountain ſealed.</hi> Water was precious in thoſe parts, therefore they ſhut up their Wells, and ſealed them, that none might draw out wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from them. The like alluſion we ſee in that viſion, <hi>Revel.</hi> 7.2, 3. <hi>And I ſaw another Angel aſcending from the Eaſt, having the ſeal of the living God, and he cryed with a loud voice to the four Angels, to whom it was given, to hurt the earth, and the Sea, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Hurt not the earth, neither the Sea, nor the trees, till we have ſealed the ſervants of our God in the foreheads.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fifthly, For ratification,<note place="margin">For ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and confirmation; for further, and more firm aſſurance. In the grants and conveyances of men
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:168215:175"/> the ſeal is to make the title unqueſtionable, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.10. <hi>I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the evidence, and ſealed it.</hi> The <hi>Corinthians</hi> converſion to Chriſt, did evidence the Apoſtles Call to work of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; and therefore he ſayes, <hi>The ſeal of mine Apoſtleſhip are ye in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.2. We find a ſeal, and earneſt given, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13, 14. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. to be one and the ſame; and the uſe of earneſts we know is for confirmation, to ratifie a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or bargain: what the Apoſtle ſaith of an oath for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that <hi>among men it for end of all ſtrife,</hi> Heb. 6.16. the ſame we may ſay of a ſeal, that puts an end to differences, and contentions. And what an oath is to a promiſe, a ſeal is likewiſe; and Gods oath added to his promiſe, is of the ſame uſe as his ſeal, <hi>that by two immutable things in which it is impoſſible for God to lye, we ſhould have ſtrong conſolations,</hi> Heb, 6.18. yea, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> the leading man in Covenant had from God both oath and ſeal added for confirmation of his promiſe; The Apoſtle makes obſervation of his oath out of Scripture-hiſtory, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.13, 14. <hi>When God made promiſe to Abraham, becauſe he could ſwear by no greater, he ſware by himſelf, ſaying, Surely bleſſing I will bleſſe thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.</hi> And here he makes like obſervation of his ſeal, God having entred Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſeed, addes this for ratification, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 17.10. <hi>This is my Covenant which ye ſhall keep between me and you, and thy ſeed after thee, Every manchild among you ſhall be circumciſed;</hi> which the Apoſtle here interprets to be both a ſign, and a ſeal. <hi>He received the ſign of Circumciſion, a ſeal of the righteouſneſſe,</hi> &amp;c. And in this reſpect Sacraments are called ſeales, to ratifie and confirm all that the Covenant doth hold out, and promiſe. That which doth the office of a ſeal, or earneſt between man and man, that is fitly called a ſeal between God and his people: But Sacraments do the ſame Offices between God and his people, as ſeales and earneſts do between man and man; ſeales and earneſts ratifie mans Covenant, Sacraments ratifie and confirm the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of God; and therefore Sacraments are fitly called ſeales.</p>
                        <p>But exceptions are here taken by thoſe that do deny that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments have any ſuch office as to be for ſeales.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Objections againſt of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</note>Firſt, <hi>This is the alone place where any Sacrament is called in Scripture by the name of ſeal; This Sacrament is onely once, and no other Sacrament any where ever ſo called: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:168215:175"/> it will not hence follow that Sacraments are ſeals.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Sol.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Anſw. 1. This will conclude them to be no ſignes, as well as it will conclude that they are no ſeales; Circumciſion is here called a ſign, and no other Sacrament is in any Scripture-Text called a ſign; yet all confeſſe that they are all ſigns. They may therefore notwithſtanding this objection be ſeales as well as ſignes. 2. The calling of it a ſeal, doth not make it one, but onely declare it to be ſuch: Before ever the Apoſtle had given it theſe names, it was both a ſign and ſeal, as well as after: other Sacraments are likewiſe ſeals, where there are like Sacramental expreſſions, notwithſtanding they have no ſuch name in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And as the Apoſtle infers from the inſtitution of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, and <hi>Abrahams</hi> acceptation of it, that Circumciſion was a ſeal, ſo may we infer in like manner, that other Sacraments are ſigns and ſeals. Compare that which the Apoſtle here deduceth from <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. concerning <hi>Abrahams</hi> Circumciſion, with that which may be deduced from <hi>Acts</hi> 8.34, 35. concerning the Eunuchs Baptiſme; <hi>Abraham</hi> believed, and was juſtified upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, and then received the ſign of Circumciſion, <hi>a ſeal of the righteouſneſſe of faith, which he had being uncircumciſed.</hi> And the Eunuch did believe on <hi>Philips</hi> preaching, and afterwards received Baptiſme. May we not well then ſay, He received the ſign of Baptiſme, a ſeal of the righteouſneſſe that he had being yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized? ſo we may ſay of <hi>Pauls</hi> Baptiſme, and the Jaylours, upon their miraculous converſion to the faith they received the ſign of Baptiſme for the ſame reaſon.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>It is demanded, whether the Covenant of grace, and promiſes of ſalvation be compleat, valid, and firm in themſelves,</hi> 
                           <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                           </label> 
                           <hi>without theſe things annexed to them? or whether they be meerly void, and null in Law, as Kings, and mens Deeds, and Charters, without a ſeal to confirm them? If incompleat, infirm, and invalid, this is extreamly derogatory to the Covenant, and therefore they are not properly ſeals.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Anſw. 1. <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                           </label> If there be ſome diſſimilitude between civill ſeals uſed by men in Charters, and conveyances, and ſeals of God put to his Covenant, will it then follow that upon that account they are no ſeals? There are diſſimilitudes between the Ambaſſadors of Princes, and the Miniſters of Chriſt reſpective to their functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are Miniſters then no Ambaſſadors? There is difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſervants of men, and ſervants of God, are Chriſtians then
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:168215:176"/> no ſervants? Sacraments are ſeals by way of metaphor, becauſe they do the office that ſeals do among men, and if they do not <hi>per omnia quadrare,</hi> as no metaphors do, yet in caſe they agree in the main for which that ſerves from whence the metaphor is borrowed, it is ſufficient. Miniſters are fitly called Ambaſſadors; being ſent of God to treat from him with a people, as Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors are ſent of Princes, notwithſtanding that thoſe to whom Ambaſſadours come, may treat, or not treat at pleaſure; may give in Propoſitions, as well as receive them; when they to whom Gods Miniſters are ſent, muſt give audience, muſt take the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions delivered, and not ſtand to Capitulate. If Sacraments ratifie to us the promiſes of the Covenant; That is enough to denominate them ſeales, though wit could deviſe twenty differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And yet I read ſome differences aſſigned, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe) I do not underſtand to be any differences at all. 2. I know not that it is abſolutely true in Law, that mens grants are void altogether, without a ſeal; I have heard of Leaſes: parol, and Wills nuncupative, which I am ſure have no ſeal. And ſeales ſometimes by the injury of time are utterly broke, and loſt; and in this caſe I ſuppoſe the Covenant may yet ſtand. 3. What is objected againſt this office of Sacraments, as ſeales, may alſo be objected againſt the oath of God made to <hi>Abraham</hi> for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of his Word. That will admit the <hi>dilemma;</hi> Either his Word of Promiſe was true, and firm without it, or elſe (which I am loath to ſpeak) ſubject to change. The appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is eaſie. The ſame thing was revealed to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in a dream for ſeven years plenty, and ſeven years famine, by a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſign; If there was truth in one, we may argue the ſecond needs not; if untrue, neither have cauſe to be heeded, or regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. If we will undertake ſuch kind of reaſonings, we ſhould make no end. 4. The Covenant is compleat, full, firm, and valid, in caſe we ſhould never more then once hear it, or never have any ſeal put to it, nor any oath for confirmation; yet our unbelief, and diſtruſt is ſuch, that we need ingeminations, incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, oaths, ſeals, and all from God to uphold us.</p>
                        <p> 
                           <label type="milestone">

                           </label> Thirdly, <hi>It is yet demanded, whether theſe ſeales are inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly annexed to the Covenant, and promiſes of grace in the Old, or New Teſtament, as parts, or parcels of them, as ſeales are annexed To the Charter? If yea, then ſhew us to what Covenants, and Promiſes, and in, and by what Texts they are thus inſeparably an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:168215:176"/> and how any can be ſaved or made partakers of the benefit of the Covenant, and promiſes of grace, who do not actually receive theſe ſeales of grace? when as your ſelves with all Orthodox Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines muſt grant, that many who were never baptized, and infinite who never received the Lords Supper, are and may be ſaved, and are made partakers of the Covenant, and promiſes of grace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out receiving, or enjoying theſe ſeales of grace. If no, then how can theſe be termed ſeales of the Covenant, and promiſes of grace, which are not inſeparably affixed to them, as ſeales are to Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſince many receive the Covenant, and promiſes of grace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe ſeales; and other receive theſe ſeales, without the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or promiſes, the benefit whereof they never enjoy.</hi>

                           </label> as being enjoyned of God (and here all the Texts brought to prove the Sacraments not arbitrary, but neceſſary; may be brought in to witneſſe) though not ſo <hi>respectu medii,</hi> The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant may have its effect without them, The Covenant is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire in it ſelf without them. They are not inſeparable <hi>quoad eſſe,</hi> yet they have their neceſſity (though not ſimple, and abſolute) <hi>quoad operari,</hi> for the Covenant to have its due work on our hearts. God ſaw them neceſſary, helpful, and uſeful, and therefore gave them in charge, as many Scriptures witneſſe, and we of neceſſity muſt ſubmit to them, in order to obtain the end to which they ſerve; and for which they are deſigned, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>

                           <hi>SECT. II.</hi> Rules for a right underſtanding of Sacramental Seales.</head>
                        <p>FIrſt, Theſe are outward, viſible ſeales;<note place="margin">Explicatory Propoſitions touching the ſealing of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</note> and priviledges of viſible Churches, and Church-memberſhip, committed to the Stewards of God in his houſe to diſpenſe, and apply to their people. And ſo different from that other ſeal of God fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently mentioned, the ſeal of the Spirit which is internal, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, proper onely to the elect, regenerate, reſerved in the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:168215:177"/> hand of God, according to prerogative to give. That theſe are external, and viſible, needs no more then our eyes; and that they are the priviledg of viſible Churches, and Church-members, ſufficient hath been ſpoken. And therefore they both agree in the general nature of a ſeal, both are for ratification, and confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the truth of Gods promiſes, yet in a different way, and different latitude; They have the former, that never reacht the latter; and the former is ſerviceable to attain to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, They are ſeales not to confirm any truth of God in it ſelf, or to work in us any aſſent to general Scripture-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, But as general truths are brought home by particular application, ſo they ſeal mens particular intereſt in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. <hi>He that hath the Son hath life; He that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life.</hi> Theſe are Scripture-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and he that is to ſeek here hath no cure in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; They can give no direct remedy. Theſe ſigns and ſeals take this for granted, and cannot make proof of it. But when this is aſſented to in the general, <hi>He that hath the Son, hath life;</hi> and he that feeds upon him, ſhall live for ever; Here ſoules are confirmed in their particular intereſts, that the Son is theirs, and that they feed upon him for life eternal.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, we muſt diſtinguiſh the outward ſign in the Sacrament together with that which is done about them, or any of them, and the Communicants act in the bare beholding of them, from our act of receiving of them. In the former ſenſe they are no more then ſignes. The Lords Supper thus conſidered is no more then a remembrance, memorial, or repreſentation of Chriſts death and paſſion. In the latter it is a ſeal, pledge or earneſt. And therefore to ſay that Chriſt ordained it to be a remembrance, memorial, and repreſentation of his death is a truth. But to ſay that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did not ordain it to be a ſeal, is a manifeſt error. If Chriſt had taken bread, and broken it; taken the cup, and poured out wine, and had ſaid, This is my body, this is my blood, here had been a ſign, a memorial, a repreſentation, and no more: But when he ſaies, <hi>Take, eat, this is my body; This is my blood in the New Teſtament, drink ye all of this;</hi> it is, as Circumciſion was, both a ſign and ſeal: As a ſign, remembrance or repreſentation; the beholding is ſufficient, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did the brazen Serpent, and as Papiſts look on their Images, for which if they had an inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:168215:177"/> as they have a prohibition, they might be defended; and if we were to do no more, it would be no more then a ſign, memorial, and repreſentation; But being to receive it, It is a ſeal, and pledge of that which it repreſents, and brings to our minds.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, They are not abſolute ſeals, but conditional; They do not make it good to all, that Chriſt is theirs; but upon Gods terms, which is expreſt by St. <hi>Peter</hi> to be the anſwer of a good conſcience towards God; Of this I ſpake largely, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the Covenant, pag. 34, 35, &amp;c. which by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his Apology hath been examined, Sect. 60, to Sect. 82. which here muſt briefly be taken into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                           <p>HAving in my Treatiſe of the Covenant, ſhewed at large that the Covenant of grace is conditional, In my ſeventh Chapter I inferr'd, that the ſeals of the Covenant are as the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant it ſelf conditional; making it good with ſix ſeveral arguments, as I had before aſſerted it in my anſwer of Mr. <hi>T.</hi> chap. 15. p. 100. This reverend Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is pleaſed to take notice of in his Apology; and to put the queſtion in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to me in theſe words, Sect. 60. <hi>Whether the Sacraments ſeal the conditional promiſe abſolutely; or the concluſion conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally; when onely one of the premiſes is of Divine revelation: and whether this concluſion be</hi> de fide, <hi>I am juſtified, and ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</hi> Which terms I leave to the intelligent Reader to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. He is not pleaſed to take notice of any one of my arguments whether it is becauſe he judges them unworthy of his anſwer, or for any other reaſon, I cannot tell. I produce likewiſe the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of many of our Divines, ſpeaking the ſame thing, and he takes as little notice of any of their authorities. As I then ſpake what reaſon inforced me to believe, ſo I have the ſame reaſon ſtill, to believe what I have ſpoke; and when all is examined,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:168215:178"/> which may be found in that apology, from p. 115, to p. 144. I think more is ſpoken for me then againſt me. He is pleaſed, pag. 139. to ſay, <hi>The difference is ſo ſmall, that were it not for ſome ſcattered by-paſſages, I would ſcarce have replyed to you.</hi> I therefore ſhall return no other rejoynder, but onely to obſerve ſuch paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as may beſt ſerve to clear the truth in queſtion; He goes about to take away the ſubject of the queſtion, and ſaies, <hi>I never heard of, nor knew a conditional ſealing in the world;</hi> which to me is very ſtrange. Beſides what I have ſpoken of it, he hath doubtleſſe read Mr. <hi>Marſhalls</hi> anſwer to Mr. <hi>T.</hi> (and, pag. 224. of his Treatiſe of Infant-Baptiſme, he makes us know that he hath read it,) and he expreſly calls it, <hi>a conditional ſeal of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers intereſt in the Covenant.</hi> He confeſſes the poſſibility, but aſſerts the vanity of ſuch ſealing. <hi>As if a man</hi> (ſaith he) Sect. 77. pag. 140. <hi>ſhould ſet the wax and material Seal to a deed of gift, with this addition, I hereby ſeal to this, or own it as my deed; if ſuch a man be now living in</hi> France, <hi>or if ſuch a ſhip be ſafe arrived, or if ſuch a man ſhall do ſuch a thing, otherwiſe this ſhall be no ſeal.</hi> Here I think an impoſſibility is found out; Is an actual Seal made no Seal upon any condition in the World? Hath he never heard of that Maxime, <hi>Quicquid eſt, quando eſt, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe eſt eſſe:</hi> or that other, <hi>Quod factum eſt, infectum reddi ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit?</hi> And we are wont to ſay, that this is not within an omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence to make a thing that is, whileſt it is, not to be: unleſſe Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> means that ſuch wax with impreſſion made, is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally no ſeal, before the time that in law it hath its efficacy, as he ſeems to ſay, Sect. 72. where he hath theſe words, <hi>To ſay, I conditionally ſeal, is to ſay, It ſhall be no ſeal, till the performance of the condition.</hi> So a bond ſealed and delivered in preſence of witneſſes, is unſealed till it be forfeited; which is a manifeſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity. And I ſpeak not of a conditional ſeal as oppoſed to actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, I ſhould call ſuch a ſeal not conditional, but potential; I ſpeak to conditional ſealing, as it is in the queſtion, that is, when a man ties himſelf by ſeal to ſuch or ſuch a thing, not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but upon condition; and ſuch ſealings I think are common in the world. A Maſter ſeals to his Apprentice, and binds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the end of his term, to apparel him, to make him free of his myſtery, &amp;c. but all this upon terms and condition of true and faithful ſervice. If <hi>Philemon</hi> in his way had ſealed to <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus,</hi> his ſeal had not tyed him to make good ſuch engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:168215:178"/> I have alwaies thought, As is the obligation, ſo is the ſeal; and if there be no ſuch conditional obligations, we have been long abuſed with ſuch forms: <hi>The condition of this obligation is ſuch, &amp;c.</hi> But if any liſt to ſay, that Sacraments abſolutely ſeal upon conditions as it ſeems Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> chooſes to ſpeak, and ſome of his friends have ſaid is more proper, (though I do not ſee it, yet) I will not contend about it. He tells me that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, that <hi>neither promiſe nor ſeal bind abſolutely, till the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be performed,</hi> pag. 140. and this is the whole that I deſire; I am there taken up for ſaying, [That the conditional promiſe is not any abſolute undoubted truth, but upon ſuppoſal of the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on put.] If the Reader compare the context either in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or ſubſequent words, he may eaſily ſee <hi>[truth]</hi> there ſhould have been <hi>[tye];</hi> and I think he could ſcarce have miſſed the ſight of it, had my ſentence been fully quoted. The cloſe of my ſpeech in theſe words [ſo both promiſe and ſeal abſolutely bind] is left out; yet the words as they ſtand, though they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry no congruity, might have received a fair Interpretation: It was no abſolute truth that the Jaylour ſhould be ſaved, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition of his believing. I ſhall not trouble the Reader with that, which to him would be tedious, and from which he can receive ſlender benefit; I ſhall onely take notice of ſome paſſages which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is pleaſed to put into his Index, ſeeing many will perhaps look there, that will go no further. <hi>The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor being ſealed, the Concluſion is not</hi> eo nomine <hi>ſealed, as Mr.</hi> Bl. <hi>affirmeth,</hi> and refers to Sect. 65. p. 123. but his charge is, p. 124. <hi>It is new Logick to my underſtanding, that the Minor being ſealed, the Concluſion</hi> eo many <hi>is ſealed: The Minor of many an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be true, and the Concluſion falſe. And therefore when the caſe ſo falls out, that both Minor, and Concluſion are true or ſealed, it is not</hi> eo nomine, <hi>becauſe the Minor is true, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is ſo, (or is ſealed</hi> eo nomine, <hi>becauſe the Minor is ſo) but becauſe both Major and Minor are ſo, and not then neither, but upon ſuppoſition the ſyllogiſm be ſound.</hi> It ſhould firſt have been made to appear that I vent ſuch Logick, and then I might more fairly have been charged with new Logick. I ſpake not of ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmes in general, but of the ſyllogiſm I had in hand, and ſuch a one where the Major is taken for granted, as I ſay it is in that ſyllogiſm. The Major in that ſyllogiſm is laid down in theſe words; <hi>If God give me Chriſt, he will give me juſtification, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:168215:179"/> by Chriſt;</hi> which is clearly laid down by the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 32. The <hi>Minor</hi> is expreſſed in theſe words (as ſuppoſed to be the words of God in the tender of the Sacrament) Here <hi>I give thee Chriſt,</hi> upon which the Concluſion followes: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>I give thee juſtification, and ſalvation.</hi> The Major in this, I ſaid, pag. 41. is ſuppoſed, not ſealed; The Minor is there ſealed, giving in my reaſon, which is not oppoſed; and the Minor being ſealed, <hi>I ſay,</hi> the Concluſion is <hi>eo nomine</hi> ſealed. This is confeſſed, upon ſuppoſition, that the Syllogiſm is found to be ſound; and the Syllogiſm is not yet under any charge, and therefore what I ſay, by his own confeſſion is true. There is further put into the Index <hi>Mr.</hi> Bl<hi>'s doctrine untrue, that [if the concluſion be not ſealed, then no propoſition is ſealed]</hi> referring to Sect. 68. pag. 126. My words quarrelled at are theſe, pag. 42. [If the Propoſition ſerves direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prove the concluſion, then that which directly confirmes any Propoſition in a rightly framed ſyllogiſm confirms the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. If the concluſion is not ſealed, then no Propoſition is ſealed, or elſe the ſyllogiſm is ill framed.] The anſwer returned me is this, <hi>This is too new doctrine to be received, without one word of proof: Doth he that ſealeth the Major of this following ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſm ſeal the concluſion? All that truely receive Chriſt, are the ſons of God, and ſhall be ſaved:</hi> Judas <hi>did truely receive Chriſt; Therefore</hi> Judas <hi>was the ſon of God, and ſhall be ſaved. I think both premiſes muſt be true, before the concluſion will thence be proved true: And it is not ſealed by God, when it is falſe.</hi> I confeſſe I ſtand amazed at this picking of quarrels, and high ſtrains of wit, to find out matter for animadverſions; If the Minor Propoſition here expreſſed, directly ſerve to prove the concluſion, then <hi>Judas</hi> is ſaved: for if it ſerve directly to that purpoſe, it is neither in matter, nor form defective. If any ſhould wickedly ſay <hi>R. B.</hi> ſhall not be ſaved, and to make it good; ſhal affirm, that he is a pure Pagan, wholly ignorant of Jeſus Chriſt; will any ſay, that this directly proves it, when the proof contains ſuch an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble falſehood? And ſuch is the proof here, that <hi>Judas</hi> is the ſon of God, and ſhall be ſaved; change <hi>Judas</hi> into <hi>Peter,</hi> and then you ſpeak my thoughts. He is pleaſed further to put into his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex, <hi>Whether it be virtually written in Scripture that Mr.</hi> Bl. <hi>is juſtified?</hi> I confeſſe I did not without trembling of ſpirit read, nor without tears think upon this, thus put to the queſtion; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with that which followes, <hi>Whether it be</hi> de fide <hi>that Mr.</hi>
                              <pb n="337" facs="tcp:168215:179"/> Bl. <hi>is juſtified?</hi> Who would not believe, that I had directly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted it, or made ſome unſavory vaunts about it? I muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore give the Reader an account, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. pag. 66. had framed this ſyllogiſm in order to the finding out of the way of Sacraments ſealing; <hi>He that believeth, and is juſtified ſhall be ſaved: But I believe: Therefore I am juſtified, and ſhall be ſaved;</hi> affirming that this concluſion <hi>[I ſhall be ſaved]</hi> is no where written, to which I anſwered, Treat. of the Covenant, pag. 42. It is written vertually, though not expreſſely: making it clear by an other inſtance: it is no where written, that I ſhall riſe in judgement; yet it is on faith, that I ſhall ariſe, ſeeing it is written that all men ſhall ariſe; and when I have concluded faith in my heart, as well as reaſon in my ſoul, knowing my ſelf to be a believer, as I know my ſelf to be a man; I may as well conclude, that I ſhall ariſe to life, as that I ſhall ariſe to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. After ſome exceptions taken by him at the word <hi>[vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally]</hi> to prove if he could, that my ſyllogiſm is tautologicall, he adds, <hi>Yet I confeſſe, that ſome concluſions may be ſaid to be</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretative vel ſecundum locutionem moralem <hi>in Scripture, when but one of the premiſes is there; but that is when the other is preſuppoſed as being certain.</hi> And do not I preſuppoſe the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor here to be certain, in ſaying, When I have concluded faith in my heart, as well as reaſon in my ſoul, I ſpeak not to it, but upon this ſuppoſition, that it is concluded; And therefor the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion may be <hi>Interpretative</hi> in Scripture according to Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> though not <hi>virtualiter,</hi> and that ſhall ſerve my turn: And I think there is as much of tautology in the one as in the other. For my concluſion in that inſtance of ariſing again, it is ſaid that, <hi>It is by faith and natural knowledge mixed, that I ſhall riſe again;</hi> and I am further told, <hi>Tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>gh in ſtrict ſenſe it be thus mixed: In our ordinary diſcourſe we muſt denominate it from one of the premiſes, and uſually from the more notable, alwayes from the more debile. Scripture ſaith, that all men ſhall riſe; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſaith, that you are a man. Though the concluſion here partake of both; yet it is moſt fitly ſaid to be</hi> de fide, <hi>both becauſe Scripture intended each particular man in the univerſal, and becauſe it is ſuppoſed as known to all that they are men: and therefore the other part is it that reſolves the doubt, and is the more notable, and more debile part.</hi> To which I onely ſay, that of two premiſes the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilior</hi> ſhould be the more notable, or that a Propoſition which is
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:168215:180"/> laid down <hi>terminis terminantibus</hi> of God himſelf ſhould be more weak, then that which reaſon concludes, I am to learn. I am further told, that <hi>it is an undoubted truth with me, that concluſio ſequitur debiliorem partem;</hi> That it followes <hi>deteriorem partem,</hi> I long ſince learnt, ſo that if one of the premiſes be falſe, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion cannot be true; but that it muſt have its denomination <hi>à debiliori,</hi> in the ſenſe here ſpoken to, I never yet heard, nor could I have once thought, that upon the account of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that Propoſition of faith, <hi>[All men ſhould riſe]</hi> it ſhould be yeelded to be of faith, that I ſhould riſe, and not otherwiſe. And here I am put to it to anſwer, whether <hi>I have a fuller evidence, that I am a ſincere believer, then I have, that all ſincere believers are juſtified?</hi> And am told, <hi>It ſeemes by your fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, that you have or ſuppoſe others to have.</hi> I wonder what words of mine thoſe are that ſpeak ſuch madneſſe. Can I be more ſure that I ſee the Sun, than I am that there is a Sun to be ſeen? I am yet told, <hi>If you have as evidently concluded, that faith is in your heart (ſaving faith) as that reaſon is in your ſoul, and know your ſelf to be a believer, as evidently as you know your ſelf to be a man, then your concluſion may be denominated to be</hi> de fide, <hi>as</hi> a parte debiliori. But what if any man have concluded, though not with that evidence, and full ſtrength of light, how it is hindred, but that ſtill it may be a concluſion <hi>de fide,</hi> I confeſſe I am to ſeek in this new learning, to enquire into premiſes, whether is <hi>debilior,</hi> whether <hi>fortior,</hi> and ſo to give the concluſion denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation <hi>à debiliori;</hi> what if I cannot tell in which of them moſt ſtrength lyes, (as it ſeems Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf is ſometimes to ſeek) then I ſhall be at a ſtand, whether the concluſion is to be denominated of faith, or of ſenſe, or reaſon; I take it to be <hi>de fide</hi> when I have warrant from the Word of God for it, and it leads me to believe it.</p>
                           <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had ſaid in his Appendix. <hi>Otherwiſe</hi> (that is, as I underſtand him, if this propoſition, I ſhall be ſaved, be ſealed in the Sacrament) <hi>every man rightly receiving the ſeales, ſhall be justified and ſaved.</hi> To this I have anſwered, I ſee no danger in yielding this concluſion; Every man rightly receiving, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the ſeales muſt be ſaved, and juſtified. He that rightly receives the ſeales, receives Chriſt in the ſeales, and receiving Chriſt, receives ſalvation. In his reply, he firſt explains himſelf, and then retorts upon me. He ſaies, <hi>by rightly I meant having
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:168215:180"/> right to it, and that onely in foro Eccleſiae, and not rectè,</hi> and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes he <hi>ſhould plainlier have expreſſed his meaning.</hi> Let him then bear with others if their words do not alwaies ſpeak their meaning ſo plainly as he would deſire. I think my meaning was never ſo in the cloudes, as his is here. He then retorts upon me, in theſe words, <hi>Whether you here contradict not your doctrine of Baptiſmal faith, where you ſuppoſe juſtifying faith to be the thing promiſed by us in Baptiſme, and therefore not prerequiſite in it, I leave you to judge, and reſolve, as by your explication.</hi> I have buſied my head not a little, to find out where any colour of contradiction lyes. If it be in this that I yield, that every man that rightly receives the Sacrament ſhall be ſaved, and yet affirm, that men that are not in a ſtate of ſalvation have right to Sacraments, then it is a contradiction to ſay, that any man may have true right to any thing that doth not rightly uſe it, which indeed is a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction much like to ſome others, with which I am charged, and might with as good reaſon have found a place in an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Having yielded to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> That Papiſts have great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage given them by thoſe, that miſtaking the nature of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith, think it conſiſts in a belief of the pardon of my own ſinnes. Yet to make it good, that the concluſion that my ſins are pardoned, or I ſhall be ſaved, may be <hi>de fide,</hi> when the ſoul hath a right proceeded in the premiſes; I ſay, As it is an error to hold, that to believe my ſinnes are forgiven, is of the nature, or eſſence of faith, as though none did believe, but thoſe that had attained ſuch aſſurance, (true faith hath aſſurance in purſuit onely, ſometimes, and not alwaies in poſſeſſion) ſo on the other hand, it is a miſtake to ſay, that it is no work of faith. The Apoſtle calls it the <hi>full aſſurance of faith,</hi> Heb. 10.22. and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth faith to be <hi>the ſubſtance of things hoped for;</hi> faith reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth ſalvation, which we have in hope to the ſoul. A deſcription of faith (ſaith Dr. <hi>Ameſius</hi> out of a Schoolman) by one of the moſt eminent acts that it produceth; therefore I take that to be a good anſwer that is here charged with error that when it is written, he that believeth is juſtified, it is equivalent, as though it were ſuch, or ſuch a man is juſtified, in caſe with aſſured grounds, and infallible demonſtrations, he can make it good to his own ſelf that he believeth. Upon this he comes in, not with a few animadverſions, the two firſt are to conclude from my
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:168215:181"/> own mouth that aſſurance is not faith, in that I ſay it is not of the nature and eſſence of faith, and hath it ſometimes onely in purſuit, and not in poſſeſſion. In which he ſeems to take for granted that I had affirmed that aſſurance is faith, when I can produce witneſſes that almoſt 30. years ago I have oppoſed it, and I ſtill perſiſt in the denyal of it. 3. He ſaies, <hi>I know none that deny aſſurance to be a work of faith, which Mr.</hi> Bl. <hi>ſaith here is a miſtake, to ſay love and obedience are works of faith, but not faith it ſelf.</hi> A work I mean as my words import, attainable by faith, and if faith by Scripture-promiſes, is able to conclude it, then the concluſion with me is <hi>de fide</hi> when it is concluded. 4. He ſaies, <hi>I muſt have better proof before I can believe that it is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of our own ſincerity, or actual juſtification, which the Apoſtle calls the full aſſurance of faith,</hi> Heb. 10.22. And I think he is the firſt man amongſt orthodox Divines, that hath doubted that aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of acceptance, is meant in that place. <hi>Faith is that grace</hi> (ſay the laſt Annotations) <hi>whereby we either do, or may approach unto God, with full aſſurance of acceptance.</hi> Is not that boldneſſe in our addreſſes mentioned, ver. 19. an evident ſymptome of it? And is not ſincerity fet forth in thoſe words <hi>[having our hearts ſprinkled from an evil conſcience, and our bodies waſhed with pure water]</hi> as the baſis, or bottome of it, not of our acceptance, but of our aſſurance? I muſt hear ſomewhat more, before I can queſtion it. There followes. 5. <hi>And as hardly can I diſcern aſſurance of our ſincerity in the deſcription of faith,</hi> Heb. 11.1. <hi>unleſſe you mean that hope is part of faith, and aſſurance the ſame with hope, both which need more proof. Hope may be without aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and when it is joyned with it, yet is not the ſame thing; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch aſſurance is a ſingular help to the exerciſe of hope.</hi> And can you not diſcern a double <hi>encomium</hi> of faith in thoſe words? The firſt with reſpect to things paſt and preſent, as well as things to come, where it is ſaid to be <hi>The evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> Faith makes that evident, which otherwiſe would not be known. The other reſpective to things to come, and that not evil, but onely good; not things feared, but hoped; expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>Faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for;</hi> both of them rather expreſſing what faith does, then what faith is; and I know not why that ſpeech of hope ſhould be brought in here, when it is onely ſaid, that the good things hoped for, are that which faith realizes to the ſoul. It is ſaid further. 6. <hi>It
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:168215:181"/> is true that faith may be ſaid (as you ſpeak) to realize ſalvation to the ſoul; that is, when the ſoul doubteth, whether there be indeed ſuch a glory and ſalvation to be expected, and enjoyed by believers as Chriſt hath promiſed ere faith apprehendeth it as real, or certain, and ſo reſolves the doubt.</hi> And is this all that faith can poſſibly do, and for which this high praiſe is here given unto it? Againſt this I ſay; Firſt, This was expreſſed in the former branch, <hi>the evidence of things not ſeen;</hi> faith believes a heaven, as well as a creation. Secondly; a faith ſhort of juſtifying may do this, an hiſtorical faith aſſents to the higheſt dogmatical truthes. Thirdly, will you have the <hi>full aſſurance of hope,</hi> Heb. 6.11. to be no other, then to get aſſurance that there is a heaven, though we ſhall never come to heaven? which would be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction; for hope hath poſſeſſion in expectation. Fourthly, doth not our hope <hi>enter into that within the vail, whither our forerunner is gone before us?</hi> Heb. 6.19. and are we not <hi>ſaved by hope?</hi> Rom. 8.24. Faith then being ſaid to be <hi>the ſubſtance of things hoped for,</hi> it doth not barely tell us that there is a heaven, (that is too lank and lean a commendation of it) but the office of it is to realize the poſſeſſion of it to us. It followes, <hi>But when the doubt is, whether I be a true believer, ſaith reſolves it not.</hi> Faith hath its hand in the reſolving of this doubt, in believing from the Scriptures, what are the Symptomes, or cognizances of true believing, and gathering them up by reflex upon it ſelf. It followes, <hi>And when the doubt is, whether this certain glory, and ſalvation ſhall be mine, faith onely cooperateth to the reſolve of it, by affording us one of the propoſitions, but not both, and not wholly the concluſion.</hi> If faith affords us one of the propoſitions, and findes the other in the Scriptures, that is to me ſufficient. It followes. 7. <hi>I am of Dr.</hi> Ameſius <hi>his mind, that it is one of faiths moſt eminent acts, by which it is there deſcribed.</hi> But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly you were not ſo in your ſixth animadverſion, when you left it ſo low, as we have heard, and made it no more then the faith of wicked men may reach. There is added, <hi>But ſo think not they that tell us, that is none of the inſtrumental juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing act which is there deſcribed.</hi> But doubtleſſe they may very well think ſo. This here mentioned is a more eminent work of faith, then that of juſtifying, as a child on a Giants head is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther removed from the earth, and nearer the clouds then the Giant himſelf; Faith that gives aſſurance, preſuppoſeth the
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:168215:182"/> juſtifying act already done by it ſelf, and addes more to it, when a man believes ſavingly there is <hi>Certitudo objecti,</hi> he that believes ſhall be ſaved, but this here mentioned is, <hi>Certitudo ſubjecti,</hi> when the good hoped for is aſſured to the ſoul. If there be any other promiſe made of God for good, this work of faith I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe takes it in, and I do not believe that the Apoſtle doth limit this work of faith to the hope of ſalvation, but I am ſure he doth not exclude it; that being the chiefeſt thing in our hope, that is undoubtedly chiefly intended, and might well by me be mentioned. It followes. 8. <hi>This which you took to be a good anſwer, is that great miſtake which hath ſo hardened the Papiſts againſt us; and were it not for this point, I ſhould not have deſired much to have ſaid any thing to you of the reſt, about conditional ſealing, as being confident, that we mean the ſame thing in the main.</hi> If that be that great miſtake, I am ſtill in the miſtake, and you are the firſt man that ever went about to rectifie it; but you herein fail, that you ſhew not wherein the miſtake lies. Thoſe Divines that deny faith to be aſſurance (that were as much as to define a man by ſuch excellencies that are to be found in few men, and ſo to exclude the common pitch of men from the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of mankind) do not yet deny but that faith may attain to aſſurance. It followes. 9. <hi>You forſake them that uſe to give this anſwer, when you confine it to thoſe onely that with aſſured grounds and infallible demonſtrations can make it good to themſelves that they believe,</hi> i. e. <hi>ſavingly.</hi> I think that they as well as I, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine it to thoſe that you here mention. It followes, <hi>I doubt that anſwer then will hold but to very few if you mean by aſſured grounds &amp;c. ſuch as they are actually aſſured, are good and demonſtrative.</hi> I believe that <hi>ſtrait is the gate, and narrow is the way that leadeth to life, and few there be that find it.</hi> There are not many, we may fear, that do ſavingly believe, and many of thoſe are not yet aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that they do believe; and to this Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath ſpoke abundantly ſufficient in his Saints reſt. It followes. 10. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations may be infallible, and yet not known to be ſuch to the perſon: but I ſuppoſe that by the word demonſtration, you intend that the party diſcerns it to be an infallible demonstration: which ſure intimates a very high kind of certainty.</hi> You may well know that I intend ſo, when you ſee that I ſay ſo, and I do not make that to be aſſurance, <hi>cui poteſt ſubeſſe falſum;</hi> If it prove in the event otherwiſe, it was not aſſurance. It followes. 11. <hi>Yet
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:168215:182"/> even in that caſe I deny that the general Premiſe in the Major is equivalent to the concluſion, I am juſtified, and ſhall be ſaved, though I ſhould acknowledg that the concluſion may be ſaid to be de fide, in that the Major hath the predominant intereſt in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion; if ſo be that the man have better evidence of his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity then of the truth of the promiſe.</hi> Neither do I ſay that that Propoſition, He that believes, and repents ſhall be ſaved, is of it ſelf equivalent with that concluſion, without the aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion with Scripture-warrant, and help of the Spirit, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and repent; and I know not what to make of ſuch ſtrange ſuppoſals of a better evidence of a mans own ſincerity in any man, then of the truth of the promiſe which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> preſently affirms to be a contradiction. There is no man comes up to ſincerity, but he that is aſſured by faith, that the promiſe is true; Though he may be ſometimes ſtaggered, yet he riſes out of it, and holds faſt to the truth of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; and when the ſoul hath evidence of both, and is aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of both, I ſay, the concluſion is <hi>de fide;</hi> ſee Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> of faith, pag. 80.</p>
                           <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſayes, Appen. pag. 71. <hi>When the Papiſts alleadge, that it is no where written [that ſuch, or ſuch a man is juſtified] we anſwer them, that it being written [that he that believeth, is juſtified] this is equivalent. A groſſe miſtake,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as if the Major Propoſition alone were equivalent to the concluſion, or as if the concluſion muſt, or can be meerly</hi> credenda, <hi>a proper object of faith, when but one of the premiſes is matter of faith, and the other of ſenſe and knowledge.</hi> In my Treatiſe of the Covenant, I op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed againſt him Dr. <hi>Goades</hi> ſpeech in a conference, expreſſing himſelf in theſe words, I will maintain the contrary againſt you, (<hi>viz. Fiſher</hi> the Jeſuite) that a concluſion may be <hi>de fide,</hi> although both Propoſitions be not <hi>de fide,</hi> but one of them otherwiſe, and infallibly true by the light of reaſon, or experience, giving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in ſuch a ſyllogiſm. Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> anſwers, Sect. 75. <hi>Dr. Goad ſaith but the ſame that I ſay, onely I diſtinguiſh, &amp;c.</hi> And I am well content then to ſay what both of them ſay, and leave it to the Reader to take the benefit of his large and elaborate diſcourſe on this occcaſion.</p>
                           <p>He is pleaſed to put into his <hi>Index, the difference between Mr.</hi> Bl. <hi>and me contracted, and a plain cogent argument added to prove, that the concluſion forementioned is not ſealed,</hi> which is the work
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:168215:183"/> of Sect. 76. pag. 139. In which much by him is granted, and much affirmed; to which I aſſent. His cogent argument that the concluſion [I ſhall be ſaved] is not ſealed, is thus framed, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſio ſequitur partem debiliorem, vel deteriorem; At propoſitio non obſignata, eſt pars debilior, vel deterior; Ergo concluſio ſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur propoſitionem non obſignatam.</hi> I ſhall give it in Engliſh, that if poſſible all may underſtand us. <hi>The Concluſion followes the weaker or worſer part: But the Propoſition unſealed is the weaker, or worſer part: Therefore the concluſion followes the Propoſition unſealed.</hi> And after many words he ſayes, <hi>For my part, I know not what ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection can be made againſt either part of the forecited argument (the Major being a common Canon or Rule that holds in all figures, and the Minor being yeeled by your ſelf) elſe I would anſwer to it.</hi> To this I might have many things to ſay. Firſt, That Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> knowed, that I did not allow of any ſuch Syllogiſm as this, which he thus frames in order to find out the ſealing of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and therefore what is here ſealed or not ſealed, with me is little to the purpoſe.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, I marvel that he makes <hi>debilior,</hi> and <hi>deterior, weaker,</hi> and <hi>worſer,</hi> here to be both one, when before he made a ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Propoſition to be <hi>debilior,</hi> the <hi>weaker,</hi> and a Propoſition of reaſon <hi>fortior,</hi> the <hi>ſtronger;</hi> when I ſhould be loath to make, or conceive (as neceſſarily he does) a Scripture-Propoſition to be <hi>deterior,</hi> the <hi>worſer.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thirdly, As to the Syllogiſm, I ſhall call for proof of both his premiſes; For the Major, in his ſenſe (if I underſtand it) I either deny, or much queſtion it, and therefore diſtinguiſh of that which is ſaid to be <hi>worſer,</hi> or <hi>weaker;</hi> which may be, either reſpective to the truth of the premiſes; and then I yeeld, that the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ever followes the worſer. If either Propoſition be falſe, the Concluſion is not true; But this ſo far as I underſtand is not his meaning: <hi>Or</hi> they may be taken reſpective to the nature of them, and then I know not that the denomination of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion muſt follow upon account, either of ſtrength or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in either of the premiſes. For the <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition, That an unſealed Propoſion is the weaker, or worſer part, I ſhall deſire to know the quantity of it, if it be univerſal, then it is falſe; Every unſealed Propoſition is not weaker, or worſer then that which is ſealed. And whereas Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſayes; I have yeelded it; I know not, that ever I was put upon it: but how I
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:168215:183"/> ſhall ſpeak my whole ſenſe of it. I yeeld that a ſeal adds to the ſtrength as does an oath, and therefore an unſealed Propoſition is weaker, then that which is ſealed <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwiſe alike in both, yet there may be thoſe differences in Propoſitions, that a Propoſition may be of that ſtrength in it ſelf that it needs no ſeal, and be every way equal for truth, and evidence to thoſe that are ſealed, and thouſands of ſuch might be named, that without any ſeal are of equal ſtrength to thoſe to which a ſeal is added. That there are lands, or tenements in the County of <hi>Salop</hi> is a Propoſition without a ſeal, that <hi>R. B.</hi> hath lands or tenements in that County is a Propoſition under ſeal, yet the latter hath no more ſtrength or evidence of truth then the former. He that hath hands lineally deſcending upon him from his Anceſtors hath a true right to inherit, is a Propoſition without a ſeal: <hi>R. B.</hi> hath ſuch, an inheritance is a Propoſition under ſeal; and I deſire to know whether here be not as much truth and evidence in the Major as the Minor. Let us look into that Syllogiſm which I put, to find out that which the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeals, and that in the perſon of God himſelf pronounced. To whom I give Chriſt, I give all things: But I give to thee Chriſt: <hi>Ergo.</hi> The firſt is without ſeal, the ſecond in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is under ſeal; yet there is as much evidence of truth in the firſt, as in the ſecond. Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Minor Propoſition muſt have its due limit (as before) or elſe it is to be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                           <p>The laſt thing in his Index as to this controverſie is,<note place="margin">The ſafety or danger to teach men to believe that they are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and ſhall be ſaved.</note> 
                              <hi>The dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of teaching men, that they are bound to believe that they are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, and ſhall be ſaved;</hi> which referres to Sect. 81. pag. 142. Where I am in the firſt place handſomely taken up, for ſaying I recede not from any that heretofore I have publiſhed on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as ſtanding not with ingenuity, when himſelf in the next Paragraphe runs on the ſame error, if an error; reſolving to maintain what he had aſſerted: I am afterwards told, <hi>It hath been too common a doctrine amongſt the moſt renowned Divines, that it is not onely</hi> de fide <hi>that I</hi> A. B. <hi>am juſtified, but every mans du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty alſo; yea, part of the Creed, and ſo a fundamental for to believe that our ſins are remitted, (for ſo expound the Article of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins) yea, they earneſtly preſſe men to believe the pardon in particular, and tell them they have but the faith of Devils elſe. By which dangerous doctrine</hi> (it is ſaid) 1. <hi>Moſt men are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:168215:184"/> to believe a falſehood, for moſt are not forgiven.</hi> 2. <hi>The careleſſe world is driven on faſter to preſumption, to which they are ſo prone of themſelves.</hi> 3. <hi>Painfull Miniſters are hindred, and their labours fruſtrated, whoſe buſineſſe is firſt to break mens falſe hopes, and peace, which they find ſo hard a work, that they need no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, &amp;c.</hi> I believe that, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſayes; this may be dangerouſly done; and I believe, that it hath not been urged by ſome without great danger; yet I alſo believe, that it may ſafely, &amp; comfortably in due order be done, and that Miniſters of Chriſt orderly and in a Goſpel-method ought to do it. For the Creed, I am ſo far from this error here mentioned, that I go not ſo farre in this thing as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf, as I have obſerved in this Apology. I do not think that the Creed it ſelf calls for ſo much as faith of adherence, to reſt or rely upon Chriſt for remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins; I ſuppoſe Creeds and Confeſſions of faith are onely for declaration of the doctrine that we hold, to difference us from thoſe that in thoſe particulars are erroneous in judgement, and do not at all intermeddle with our will or affections. Though I know the will muſt conſent, and by the affections imbrace and receive Chriſt, or elſe there is no ſalvation to which the Goſpel calls us.</p>
                           <p>The danger mentioned I fear too often (as I ſaid before) is ſadly incurred, that brand of falſe Prophets, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.22, 23. is heavy, <hi>Becauſe with lyes ye have made the heart of the righteous ſad, whom I have not made ſad, &amp; ſtrengthened the hands of the wicked, that he ſhould not return from his wicked way, by promiſing him life: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye ſhall ſee no more vanity, nor divine divinations; for I will dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my people out of your hands, and ye ſhall know that I am the Lord.</hi> This practice is in full oppoſition to God, (who every where threatens death to wicked perſons) which as many obſerve well all the error of thoſe that ſuffered the charge of falſe Prophets among the Jewes; we read not that they delivered any poſitive untruths, but onely made undue applications. And therefore falſe Prophets among them, are diſtinguiſhed from falſe teachers, which were to ariſe in Chriſtian Churches, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1 The latter, and not the former bringing in damnable hereſies, and yet the former were of like danger in their miſapplication, both of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and threatenings, and more eſpecially of promiſes; to urge all to believe, that in <hi>ſtatu quo,</hi> they ſhall be ſaved, is indeed to teach them to preſume, ſeeing ſalvation is not every mans por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:168215:184"/> and the portion of no man that lyes in ſin: It was a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that the Apoſtle often preacht, that ſuch ſhould not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom of heaven, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.21. and he lets the <hi>Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> know that all thoſe are but vain deceiving words that teach otherwayes, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.6. Yet I ſuppoſe that it is a Chriſtians priviledge, that he may believe that his ſins are forgiven, and that he ſhall he ſaved; and being his priviledge, it is alſo his duty. Chriſt requires ſome to believe it, Be of good cheer, thy ſins are forgiven, <hi>Matth:</hi> 9.2. And the Apoſtle takes it for granted, that ſome were aſſured; Ye have ſuffered joyfull the ſpoiling of your goods, knowing that in heaven ye have a better and far more induring ſubſtance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.32. Why doth <hi>Peter</hi> call upon Chriſtians, to give diligence to make their calling and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection ſure? 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. Or why did <hi>John</hi> write to thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on the Name of the Son of God, that they might know that they have eternal life, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.13. in caſe they may not be aſſured, and accordingly by faith be full perſwaded and ſatisfied in it? We may not think that aſſurance is held out in Scriptures as Chimaera, or as a Chymiſts Philoſophers Stone, to be talked of, but never compaſſed. And I ſuppoſe <hi>ſano ſenſu,</hi> and with due qualifications it may be aſſerted, That every viſible Church-member is bound to believe his own ſalvation, and the pardon of his own ſins in particular. I well remember that I had once conference with Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> in Mr. <hi>Aſh's</hi> houſe on this thing, (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion of that old argument inſiſted upon by Arminians; That which all are bound to believe is true: But all are bound to believe that Chriſt dyed for them) and he determined that all are bound to believe that Chriſt dyed for them in particular, and that all the fruits of his death ſhall be theirs, not immediately, but <hi>Mediante fide &amp; reſipiſcentia;</hi> Men are bound to faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and uppn their faith and repentance are bound to get this aſſurance, which it ſeems is alſo Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> thoughts by that which he adds in the fifth place for aggravation of this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, when wicked men that have but the faith of Divels, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately required to believe the pardon of their own particular ſins, and this made to be <hi>de fide,</hi> God is diſhonoured with the charge of ſuch untruths, as if falſehoods were <hi>de fide,</hi> and God commanded men to believe them. It ſeems then that he grants that men may be mediately required to believe the pardon of their own ſins in particular, and there can never be too much
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:168215:185"/> ſpoken againſt an urging of it in an immediate way; It is after we have done the will of God that we ſhall receive the promiſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.36. and we muſt not believe that without doing his will we ſhall ever receive it. Promiſe-preachers that are not duty-prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, that hold out bliſſe, and never ſpeak of the terms or means to attain it, are no other then deceivers. To ſpeak large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Fathers bowels to receive, and not a word of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digals duty to come in, or the multitude of ſins that were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given that ſinner in the City (ſuppoſed to be <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>) and conceal her tears of repentance; to be large in one, and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in the other, is the way to heal with ſlight words. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſayes, <hi>The ungodly that I deal with are ſo confident that their ſin is forgiven, and God will not damn them for it, that all that I can ſay, is too little to ſhake their confidence, which is the nurſe of their ſin.</hi> When he makes this his buſineſſe, he does the work of the Prophets, of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and of Chriſt Jeſus; and I wiſh that all the labourers in the Lords work may joyn with him in that way, and that the Lord may give ſucceſſe. Yet I ſtill believe that all this is to be done in order to a well ſetled, and firmly grounded confidence: when he tells thoſe that come to Chriſt, and hear his words, and do them not: clayming ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by him, and not obeying him, that they build their hopes on a ſandy foundation, and fooliſhly deceive themſelves; I believe that he tells thoſe that hear, and accordingly yeeld obedience, that their hopes of ſalvation have a firm bottom as a houſe built upon a rock. But I know not why all of this ſhould here in this place be brought in; in the cloſe of all that hath paſt (as he ſayes) concerning himſelf, unleſſe it be, to bear men in hand, that my doctrine of conditional ſealing in the Sacraments, (which he yet confeſſes differs little from his own) may be charged with this danger, when I ſuppoſe it is the alone way of prevention of it. If I ſhould make the words of the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an abſolute tender, and the ſeal wholly unconditional, I know not how to avoid it; and I may very well fear, that he cannot be without ſome ſuch meaning. Firſt, In that he puts into his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex (as we have heard) <hi>The danger of teaching men that they are bound to believe that they are juſtified, and ſhall be ſaved,</hi> amidſt thoſe things, in which none but I are concerned; and Secondly, Where he firſt begins with me he utters like language, pag. 3. <hi>I doubt not</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>but the difference between you and me, is onely
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:168215:185"/> about the methodizing of our notions, and not</hi> de ſubſtantia rei, <hi>and yet</hi> preſently adds, <hi>but I doubt leſt your doctrine being received by common heads, according to the true importancy of the expreſſion may do more againſt their ſalvation then is well thgouht on, and that not by accidence, but from its own nature, ſuppoſing the impreſſion of the ſoul to be but anſwerable to the objective doctrinal ſeal:</hi> How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy am I in methodizing of wholeſome truths, which are the ſame in ſubſtance with a mans of ſuch eminence? If that alone ſhould have ſuch a ſad influence upon mens underſtanding, though age growes upon me, and many other weakneſſes; yet were I ſenſible of the truth of this charge, I would travel on foot to the remoteſt ground in <hi>England</hi> to learn from any hand a more happy way, and I have therefore been more large, that the Reader may ſee the whole of my thoughts in this where I may ſeem to be under ſo heavy a cenſure, that he may help me in prayer, that in all that I do I may edifie, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy.</p>

In ſuch a caſe we deſire, 1. A promiſe, that he from whom we expect it, would engage himſelf by his word for it. This Chriſt hath done in the Goſpel-promiſes, we have his promiſe frequently repeated, ſtill inculcated, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.12. <hi>And thou ſaidſt, I will ſurely do thee good, and make thy ſeed as the ſand of the Sea, which cannot be numbred for multitude,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.8. <hi>Godlineſſe is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto all things, having the promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come,</hi> Joh. 11.25. <hi>I am the reſurrection, and the life; he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet he ſhall live.</hi> 2. When we have a word, we yet deſire an oath, that the perſon
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:168215:186"/> by that ſacred tye, may be obliged not to recede, or go back from that which he hath ſpoke; This God hath vouchſafed. when God made promiſe to <hi>Abraham, becauſe he could ſwear by no greater, he ſware by himſelf, that by two immutable things in which it was impoſſible for God to lye, we might have a ſtrong conſolation, who have fled for refuge, to lay hold upon the hope ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</hi> 3. When we have both word, and oath, yet we deſire his hand, that it may be ſubſcribed, that we may have ſomewhat to produce and ſhew for that which we expect; This God hath vouchſafed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.31. <hi>Theſe are written that ye might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Sonne of God, and that believing ye might have life through his Name,</hi> Rom. 15.4. <hi>Whatſoever things were written afore-time, were written for our learning, that we through patience, and comfort of the Scriptures, might have hope.</hi> 4. Yet we deſire earneſt, a pledge in hand, to make good what is in Covenant, and promiſe paſt, and by oath under hand confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; This God is pleaſed to vouchſafe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. <hi>In whom alſo after that ye believed, ye were ſealed with that holy Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which is the earneſt of our inheritance, untill the redemption of the purchaſed poſſeſſion,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.21, 22. <hi>Now he which eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſheth us with you in Chriſt, and hath anointed us, is God, who hath alſo ſealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.</hi> 5. We yet deſire a ſeal, As <hi>Jeremy</hi> had the evidences of his purchaſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.10. This God hath alſo vouchſafed, and this is of two ſorts. 1. Inward by his own immediate hand, the ſtamp of his Spirit, the impreſſe of his grace. This is the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or mark that we are his, theſe God ſets apart for himſelf, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.30. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.21, 22. 2. Outward put into the hands of his Miniſters, and theſe are Sacraments, theſe outward viſible aſſurances. The former needs no conditions but it ſelf, all ſanctified are ſaved, and ſanctification is the ſeal, there are all Goſpel-conditions. The latter requires all the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous qualifications of a people in Covenants. All that are thus qualified, according to the Goſpel, have here full confirmation, and aſſurance of intereſt in all promiſes; ſo willing is God eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way to condeſcend to our weakneſſe, to anſwer what infirmity can expect, or feebleneſſe crave. We might think that <hi>Gideon</hi> was exceeding bold with God, to ask a double ſign for the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening of his faith in the promiſe of God, to ſave <hi>Iſrael</hi> by his hand; yet we ſee God is pleaſed to gratify him, <hi>Judg</hi> 6.39, 40.
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:168215:186"/> yet God deales more abundantly with us, not onely in a double, but a multiplied confirmation, to make good every truth which he hath been pleaſed to manifeſt. And as he teacheth us by ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes drawn from earthly things, as we ſee in the Prophets, and parables from our Saviours mouth, ſo alſo to ſpeak to our eyes, in theſe ſignes and ſeales ratifying, and confirming heavenly things unto us. Thoſe great mercies which no thought can reach are ſet out in ſo obvious a way, that every eye doth behold and ſee. That water which we employ for our common uſe, and among other neceſſary ſervices cleanſes all filth that cleaves to us, ſerves to ſet out that great myſtery of the blood and Spirit of Chriſt, taking away both guilt and filth of ſin. The bread which we have at our table, the wine which we drink for our food and repaſt, that ſets out both the attonement, and divine nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, which our ſoules find in the fleſh and blood of Chriſt crucified and dying for us. There is abundant weakneſſe and tottering in our faith, that needs in this manner to be ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Abundance of ſweet mercies in our God that will vouchſafe this to ſtrengthen and ſupport us.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, If Chriſt thus condeſcends to our weakneſſe,<note place="margin">Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us ſhould move us to compaſſionate our ſelves.</note> in making proviſion of theſe helps, let us learn to have compaſſion of our ſelves, and not neglect, or deſpiſe ſo great favours. If Chriſt had judged us to have been of ſtrength, he had never tendred us this crutch; and when he ſees that we need it, and therefore hath provided it, let us ſee that we do not reject, or deſpiſe it. Is it not to imitate <hi>Ahaz</hi> in his obſtinacy, who when he could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the promiſe that God would deliver him, and his people from the combined power of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> that were then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and having a ſign tendred him of God, either in the depth beneath or the height above, for his aſſurance in the thing, he anſwers, <hi>he will not deſire a ſign,</hi> Iſa. 7.11, 12. he will rather dwell in his unbelief, and periſh. As that ſign was to that promiſe, ſo all Sacraments are to Gods great promiſe. He that caſts away Sacraments indulges unbelief, and we may well fear, that he ſhall dwell in it to deſtruction.</p>

                        <p>The text that we have under our hand is abundantly full to his purpoſe; Scarce any text holds out a truth (I may ſay) more clear and full, then this text doth; that which is here delivered if we take in the context with it,<note place="margin">The Context opened.</note> to which the copulative <hi>[And]</hi> leads. The Apoſtle having in the former Chapter delivered the doctrine of juſtification by faith, goes on here to make it good by the Example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his argument rendred in ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtical form appears to be this: As <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of the faithful was juſtified, ſo muſt all the faithful. This is taken for granted, as needing no proof: But <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of the faithful was juſtified, not by works, but by faith. The Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſiſts of two parts, and the Apoſtle proves both. 1. The negative that he was not juſtified by works, this he proves by two arguments. 1. If he were juſtified by works, then he hath whereof to glory, ver. 2. But he hath not whereof to glory before God; <hi>Ergo</hi> he was not juſtified by works. 2. If he were juſtified by works, the reward were reckoned not of grace, but of debt, ver. 4. But the reward is not of debt, but of grace: <hi>Ergo.</hi> Which he further confirmes by the teſtimony of <hi>David;</hi> deſcribing the bleſſedneſſe of man to whom the Lord imputeth righteouſneſſe without works, ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed are they whoſe ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities are forgiven, and whoſe ſinnes are covered. Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute ſin,</hi> ver. 7, 8. As <hi>David</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes bleſſedneſſe, that way man is bleſſed; But <hi>David</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes it to be by imputation of righteouſneſſe, and not by works: <hi>Ergo.</hi> The affirmative that <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified by faith, he
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:168215:187"/> proves by a full teſtimony of Scripture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.6. <hi>He believed in the Lord, and he counted it to for him for righteouſneſſe.</hi> Now it might be objected, that this juſtification of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and bleſſedneſſe that <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of, was nothing to the Gentiles uncircumciſed, but to the Jewes in the ſtate of Circumciſion, and ſo Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may yet have an hand in juſtitification. This the Apoſtle denies, ver. 10. and proves the contrary by the time of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> juſtification, which was in uncircumciſion, not in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion. If <hi>Abraham</hi> were juſtified in uncircumciſion, then Circumciſion, hath no hand in juſtification; But <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified in uncircumciſion. <hi>Ergo:</hi> But then the greateſt queſtion is, to what end or purpoſe he was circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, having already that righteouſneſſe which doth juſtify, what needs more? Circumciſion then might have been let alone. The Apoſtle anſwers that he was circumciſed on a twofold ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, for a double reaſon. The firſt is in reference to his own eſtate in faith, which equally concerns all in his ſtate of believing. <hi>He received the ſign of Circumciſion, a ſeal of the faith which he had being yet uncircumciſed.</hi> The ſecond in reference to the whole Church, <hi>that he might be the Father of all that believe,</hi> in Circumciſion or in uncircumciſion; ſo that we have both the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles authority and his argumentative diſcourſe for confirmation of our point, That the work and efficacy of Sacraments is by way of ſign and ſeal. We ſhall find <hi>Peter</hi> giving his vote with <hi>Paul</hi> in this thing (where he enters a diſpute about Baptiſme, as <hi>Paul</hi> here doth about Circumciſion, as you may find, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.20, 21.) having mentioned Gods long ſuffering towards diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient ones, in the daies of <hi>Noah,</hi> while the Ark was a preparing, he ſaies; <hi>Few, that is, eight ſoules were ſaved by water.</hi> That ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which (as an executioner of divine vengeance) deſtroyed the world of the ungodly, as an inſtrument in the hand of God, preſerved <hi>Noah</hi> and his family. It deſtroyed the world by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming of them, as after it did <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoſt. It ſaved <hi>Noah</hi> and his houſehold by keeping the Ark above trees, rocks, mountaines, buildings, or whatſoever might have been their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine. Then he parallells Baptiſme with it; <hi>The like figure where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto even Baptiſme doth alſo now ſave us, not the putting away the filth of the fleſh, but the anſwer of a good conſcience towards. God by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> which according to Interpreters, implyes no more then a reſemblance, or, as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeaks, a
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:168215:188"/> correſpondence, though, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. the Apoſtle uſeth the ſame word otherwiſe. The Ark then ſaved a few, when the reſt were deſtroyed; Baptiſme now ſaves a few by the reſurrection of Chriſt. <hi>It will alwaies be</hi> (ſaith <hi>Calvin</hi> on the words) <hi>as it was in Noahs daies, when mankind runnes on their own ruine, God wonderfully ſaves ſome from the common destruction.</hi> But here an objection lies, that <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark, and New Teſtament Baptiſme are nothing, parallell, few entred that, but now numerous, or rather innumerable multitudes are baptized. The Apoſtle anſwers, that the parallell lyes not between the outward Baptiſme, that is, the outward act, as man adminiſters it, which he calls putting away the filth of the fleſh, which we know is the work of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, but the anſwer of a good conſcience, or the reſtipulation of a good conſcience. I deſire now to know how the Apoſtle can be ſalved from a contradiction. He ſaies, Baptiſme ſaves, and yet ſaies, the outward putting away the filth of the fleſh doth not ſave, but the anſwer of a good conſcience towards God. Now this putting away the filth of the fleſh, done in the Name of Chriſt, or in the Name of the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, is Baptiſme; ſo is not the anſwer of a good conſcience, that is no Baptiſme. The Apoſtle then ſhould rather have ſaid, that the anſwer of a good conſcience ſaves, and not Baptiſme. But he ſaies, Baptiſme ſaves. I ſee no other way of reconciliation, or to make ſenſe of his words, then to underſtand him that Baptiſme ſaves, as it hath its work on the conſcience, as it works upon our underſtanding, and our faith as a ſign and ſeal, and is no immediate conveyance of happineſſe, not any other way of conveyance, then as it hath its work on the conſcience of the receivers.</p>

                           <hi>Reaſons.</hi> Firſt, The Word and Sacraments work after one and the ſame manner on the ſoul for ſalvation, reſpective to any medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, or immediate way of conveyance of any graces or priviledges. This is evident, in regard of that relation that the Sacraments have to the Word, as appendants to it. But the force of the Word on the ſoul to ſalvation is not inherent, not by any immediate conveyance of inward graces or priviledges, but as it hath its work on the underſtanding, and faith of him that receiveth it; they that underſtand not are as the highway-ground that gaines nothing. It is the <hi>power of God for ſalvation to them that believe,</hi> Rom. 1.16. It profits not where it is not mixtwith faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. It is effectual onely in thoſe that believe, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. The bare
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:168215:188"/> work done in hearing ſaves none, and ſo alſo it is with Sacraments.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Signes and pledges added to promiſes, are efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous no other ways then as they work upon the underſtanding and faith of thoſe that receive them as ſignes, This may be made good in particular inſtances, in a large induction of ſignes of all ſorts. The double ſign vouchſafed of God to <hi>Gideon</hi> for his confirmation in the deliverance of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Judg. 6. did not work at all towards ſuch a deliverance further then as it had its work upon the underſtanding and faith of <hi>Gideon,</hi> to whom it was given. The Scarlet thred in <hi>Rahabs</hi> window had no power for her ſafety, further then it was a ſign between her and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> minding <hi>Joſhua</hi> of his engagement to her. The rainbowe is of no power to ſave the world from an univerſal deluge of water, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then it minds and aſſures us of Gods promiſe. The ſame we may ſay of all ſignes and pledges both humane and divine: But Sacraments are ſignes, and pledges added to promiſes, as we ſee here in the text: Sacraments then have no others efficacy then, as they work on the underſtanding and faith of the receivers.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, There is nothing that is material, ſenſible, corporeal, that hath any immediate influence, or operation upon any object that is ſpiritual. This is plain. There muſt be proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the agent, and the patient, the inſtrument working, and the object wrought upon: But the Sacramental ſignes that we receive as ſeales are material, corporeal, ſenſible; and therefore have no ſuch immediate influence upon the ſoul for the work of grace, or conveyance of it.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, If this Scripture hold out the work of Sacraments, onely by way of ſign and ſeal, and no other Scripture holds out any other work to be wrought by them in the ſoul, then this is the whole of their work. This is clear, Scripture muſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where hold out the whole, that Sacraments effect: But this is the whole that the Apoſtle in this Scripture gives to them, where he gives an account of the fruit of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Circumciſion, neither is there any other Scripture in which any more is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the working of Sacraments. The aſſumption is of two parts, The firſt none can queſtion, that the Apoſtle aſcribes no more here to Sacraments then as hath been ſaid. For the ſecond, that no other Scripture aſcribes any thing further to them, ſhall God willing be made good, when we come to examine thoſe Scriptures which are brought in by way of objection for a further work.</p>

                           <hi>It is diſputed whether Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are onely ſignes and ſeales of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, or outward ſignes annext the Covenant and appointed for this of God, that they ſhould ſignify ſaving grace of God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Covenant, and ſignifying ſeal, and after their manner confirm our faith, and give publick teſtimony of it, which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the common opinion of Proteſtants, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be further efficient cauſes of this
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:168215:189"/> ſaving and juſtifying grace, or whether they be effective inſtruments of this grace appointed of God for this thing, that they ſhould indeed containe it in them, and convey it, which is the opinion of all Papists.</hi> Vorſtius, Anti. Bellar. ad Contro. 1 Gen. And our men further judge that opinion of the <hi>opus operatum,</hi> or of the outward Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental action (as though without the faith, and pious motion of thoſe that uſe it, it could juſtifie any) to be evidently falſe and pernicious: And they teach, that all Sacraments by the ordination of God himſelf have onely a power to ſignifie and ſeal, and not to conferre the grace of the Goſpel it ſelf. And whereas ſeveral paſſages in the <hi>Liturgy</hi> of this Church did ſeem to favour the oppoſite opinion, affixing adoption, member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Chriſt, and inheritance of the Kingdom of heaven, and regeneration to Baptiſme: we know how great offence it gave to many eminently Learned and pious, putting them upon omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of thoſe paſſages: And alſo what Interpretation, as with a grain of ſalt, others put upon them, that they were onely Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally ſuch. And doubtleſſe theſe either hit upon the meaning of the Church (which was held to theſe phraſes, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of many hyperbolical ſpeeches in the Fathers) or elſe the Church had miſt the meaning of Scriptures; ſo loth were the ſons of the Church to be quarrelling with their mother, and yet more loth with her to run into errors.</p>
                        <p>The Obſervation it ſelf, if heeded, hath a caution or limit in it; Affirming that Sacraments work no otherwiſe then as ſigns and ſeals; and that they conferre no inward graces or priviledges further then they work upon the underſtanding, and faith of thoſe that receive them: it implyes, that they do conferre what an outward ſymbole, or ſign is apt to, and of powder to convey; and that outward priviledges in Sacraments, are either conferred, of infallibly evidenced. This is clear, the Apoſtle having ſo far undervalued Circumciſion in the fleſh, as to make it Parallell with uncircumciſion, ſo that a circumciſed Jew, and an uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed Gentile differed nothing as to their Spiritual ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; inferres by way of objection, What advantage then hath the Jew, and what profit is there of circumciſion? And anſwers, not that outward circumciſion is altogether unprofitable, but that it hath much profit, and inſtances in one eminent one, <hi>To them are committed the Oracles of God.</hi> This is the <hi>inheritance of the Congregation of Jacob,</hi> Deut. 33.4. as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks; and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:168215:190"/> with it this great priviledge, it conveyes with it all other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Church-priviledges; right to the Paſſeover upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count was theirs, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48. and not otherwiſe: So it is with Baptiſme, men are taken into the Church at this door, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Commiſſion given to the Apoſtles, <hi>Diſciple all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, &amp;c.</hi> Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were, and whomſoever they profeſſedly ſerved before, they are this way taken in as the conſecrate ſervants of the whole Trinity, and added to the Church, <hi>Act</hi> 2.47.

And though we deny Orders to be any Sacrament, yet we confeſſe there is that relation in Miniſters to Chriſt by vertue of their Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is not in thoſe that are not called to the work of the Miniſtery. There are thoſe indeed that do deny it; But thoſe that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> had to deal with, and that he charges for Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, as <hi>Luther, Melancthon, Calvin, Beza, Peter Martyr, Chemnitius</hi> willingly yeeld it. And in caſe this were all the character that they talke of to be imprinted in Baptiſme; yea, in Ordination, we ſhould never contend about it. And as theſe priviledges are conferred as to actual intereſt in the initiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacraments, both of Baptiſme, and Circumciſion; ſo the ſame priviledges in the following Sacraments are infallibly evidenced, as appears in that text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17. The Apoſtle there ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it his buſineſſe to take off Chriſtians from their reſort to the
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:168215:190"/> Idols temples, to eat there of that which had been offered in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, which they judged to be within the verge of their liberty; An Idol being nothing in the world, tells them, that as joyning with Jewes in their ſacrifice offered on the Altar, did declare them to be one body with the Jewes; and eating of the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal bread, did make them one body Chriſtian; ſo alſo going to the Heathens ſacrifices, did evidence them to be one body Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. The Apoſtle, as we ſee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.5. thought no underſtanding man would queſtion it, we muſt therefore readily yeeld it; which holds true of the Paſſeover, ſeeing onely the circumciſed who were in ſaith Jewes, were to be admitted do it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48. And this I ſuppoſe is that which Reverend <hi>Gataker</hi> means, oppoſing that tenent, that the Sacraments conferre grace by the work done, where there is no barre put, and having quoted teſtimonies of Biſhop <hi>Abbot, Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Whitaker,</hi> ſharpely enough de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring themſelves againſt it, adds, <hi>That for the axiome it ſelf I will not contend about it, if that effect of the Sacraments be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, for which they were inſtituted of God, and the Word be taken in a more large ſenſe for all that whatſoever it be that may be any impediment, that the Sacraments cannot have their effect.</hi> Though perhaps in theſe words of his he had ſome other intentions. It were an endleſſe labour to lanch out into the controverſie, and to gather up the various opinions of thoſe of a contrary judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and their different thoughts to make good their tenents, whether of thoſe that deny Sacraments to be Seales, as generally the Papiſts, whom Anabaptiſts in this follow at the heels, as in moſt other things both about the Covenant, and Sacraments; Or <hi>Lutherans,</hi> who yeelding them to be ſeales, as well as ſignes, yet affirim that theſe are leſſe principal offices, and uſes of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: the chief end is to be inſtruments of conveyance of grace to the ſoul; Or diſſenting brethren among Proteſtants, ſome of them falling in with Popiſh Schoolmen, &amp; wholly cloſing with their tenent, that Sacraments conferre grace where no bar is put to hinder their working; or others that hold it with limit onely to Baptiſme, and that to elect children, not daring to put reprobates into a ſtate of regeneration, or remiſſion of ſin, nor yet to aſſert that the elect are alwayes thus regenerate in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme; But that it holds ſo in ordinary: Or of ſome (that I have met with in diſcourſe) that ſuppoſe that Baptiſme hath his work in thoſe elect infants, where God foreſees that death will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:168215:191"/> their regeneration by the Word: or others that ſay, that God works by Baptiſme to regeneration, and forgiveneſſe of ſin; but according to pleaſure, they dare not aſſign to whom. Some of theſe I judge to be more evidently oppoſite to the Scripture then others; yet I confeſſe, I ſee not foundation in the Word for any of them. Theſe that are thus agreed, that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as inſtruments conferre grace, without reſpect had to the receivers faith, yet are at odds among themſelves, what manner of inſtruments they are. He that pleaſes may read in <hi>Suarez, diſput.</hi> 9. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 62. <hi>art.</hi> 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. ſix ſeveral opinions about it; <hi>ſome</hi> will have them to be no efficient, but material cauſes onely, as a diſh conveying a medicine, is no cauſe of health, but a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial inſtrument onely of conveyance. <hi>Others</hi> hold that they conferre grace <hi>per modum impetrationis,</hi> becauſe the Miniſter and the Church obtaines of God by prayer grace by them. <hi>Others</hi> ſay, that they are conditions without which God gives not grace <hi>Others</hi> yet ſay, that the Sacraments are cauſes of grace, becauſe when they are applyed, they move God to conferre it. As we ſay they work by way of ſign on our underſtanding, ſo they ſay they work by way of ſign with God, moving him to remember his promiſe. <hi>Others</hi> ſay, they conferre grace, becauſe God in a more ſpecial manner appears in them as a principal agent, or effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; which my Authour complaines is very obſcure. But he that will conſult the Authour of this opinion, which is <hi>Henricus à Gandavo Quod. quart. quaeſt.</hi> 37. may find much againſt any power in the Sacraments to conferre, or to ſpeak in his language, to create grace in the ſoul; creation being ſolely the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of God, and above the power of any creature to be aſſiſtent in it; yet leſt he ſhould run upon an hereſy againſt the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Catholick Church, in making them no more then ſigns and ſeals, he is put upon it to come off thus blewly, that <hi>Suarez</hi> with all his high wit cannot find out his meaning. <hi>Suarez</hi> himſelf concludes, that they are Phyſical inſtruments in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of grace, and that they are cauſes of grace; becauſe by a true Phyſical action they concur to the ſanctification of men. Having with much adoe endeavoured to prove a poſſibility of their working of grace in a Phyſicall way, he concludes, that this is their way of working, and that not barely in working ſome diſpoſition towards grace, not reaching grace it ſelf, nor yet in working an union only of grace with the ſoul; But in the
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:168215:191"/> moſt proper and rigorous ſenſe, Sacraments Phyſically work grace; the very Phyſicall action by which Grace is wrought, and drawn out of the obediential power of the ſoul, truly, real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Phyſically depending on the Sacraments, which he judges to be moſt agreeable to the dignity of the Sacraments; the phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Scripture, and Councels, and Fathers about them. But it might pitty the Reader to ſee how miſerably he comes off with this aſſertion of his, only telling us, that <hi>the Scripture ſayes, we are cleanſed, ſanctified, or regenerate of water, or the laver of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and waſhing of water in the Word of life,</hi> without the leaſt light given us, to let us underſtand that theſe phraſes muſt be taken in his Phyſical ſenſe meaning: adding ſome ſentences of Fathers, who ordinarily give that in their writings to the ſign, which is proper to the thing ſignified, finding yet oppoſite ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences in them, that much troubles him, in which in an ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, way, they explain themſelves ſufficiently againſt his poſition. In caſe in this poſition of his of the Phyſicall working of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he had only underſtood, that they work according to the nature of the office, and place aſſigned unto them, there might have been juſt cauſe to have ſubſcribed to his judgment. It is of the nature of a ſign to hold forth to us the thing ſignified, of a relative ſymbole, to ingage to the filling up of ſuch a relation. It is of the nature of a ſeal to confirm every grant paſt in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: but to give a Phyſicall power to thoſe elementary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to create Grace in, or confer grace upon the ſoul, is a monſtrous tenent. A little Philoſophy will accquaint us with the natural properties of water, and as applyed in waſhing expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience will ſoon diſcover it. The Pſalmiſt alſo ſhewes the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which nature gives to bread, and wine, <hi>Pſal</hi> 104. But for either water, bread, or wine to pardon ſin, infuſe habits, or new qualities into the ſoule; or add to the ſtrength of thoſe that are already wrought, is an unheard of ſecret. <hi>Others</hi> yet ſay that they are hyperphyſical, or ſupernatural inſtruments in the conveyance of grace, which might eaſily enough be underſtood, in caſe it could be believed. A power they mean put into them, or exerciſed by them, above that which in their naturall work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings they have any poſſible activity to reach, as in the water of the Poole of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> upon the moving of the Angell to heal him that firſt ſtept into it, and in the water of <hi>Jordan</hi> to cleanſe <hi>Naaman</hi> of his Leproſie by ſeven times dipping in it. Had it
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:168215:192"/> had, that naturall power of cure <hi>Abana</hi> and <hi>Pharpar</hi> rivers of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> would never have been eſteemed equall with it. But that theſe elements ſhould be ſtanding inſtruments of the work of miracles of this nature, we had need of full and clear texts of Scripture to make good to us. I ſhall aſſoon believe a tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation in the bread from <hi>hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> as ſuch a tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or renovation of the ſoul, or any ſuch priviledges of glory: as Scripture makes the peculiar inheritance of thoſe in whom this change is wrought, upon the bare application of theſe Elements. Moſt ſay they are morall inſtruments in what they do; but then there is ſo much work to underſtand what a morall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument means, that I dare neither without further expreſſion of my ſelf affirm or deny it. Some make them ſuch inſtruments by which God works according to pleaſure, ſometimes working that which they ſignifie, and ſometimes working not at all by them, as ſometimes he works by the Word: but ſometimes it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a dead letter. <hi>Others</hi> make it an inſtrument of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as a ſtaffe of an Abbotſhip, a pall df a Biſhoprick, a Book of a Canons place, and this doubtleſſe is according to the meaning of Scriptures; as men vouchſafing gifts appoint at pleaſure Ceremonies, and Solemnities evidencing ſuch donations, ſo God hath appointed theſe elements as ſigns of that nature. Having a precedent right, the initiating Sacrament is a means of ſolemn inauguration, and the following Sacrament an evidence of continued poſſeſſion. Baptiſme takes into the body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. and Bread and Wine evidence that we are of the body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17. And as a twig, and turfe veſts a man in his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of lands, a rod veſts a cuſtomary tenant in his Coppy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, a Crown veſts a King in his Kingdom; ſo theſe elements (having this office aſſigned them of God) veſt a man in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in viſible Church-memberſhip, and give him actual intereſt in all viſible Church-priviledges. But yet this difference, The <hi>Staffe,</hi> the <hi>Pall,</hi> the <hi>Book,</hi> the <hi>Twig,</hi> and <hi>Turfe,</hi> the <hi>Rod,</hi> the <hi>Crown,</hi> lead no further then to that which they immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, which is the preſent dignities, and poſſeſſing whereof they are ſolemnities, and theſe dignities are alſo terminated in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and lead men into no expectation of any higher honour. But Sacraments veſting us in Church-priviledges, and theſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges leading us to higher and greater things as they veſt us in preſent in theſe, ſo by way of ſign and ſeal, they lead, and raiſe
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:168215:192"/> us unto all that Church-priviledges ſerve, and are appointed to advance us unto. So that God works as a Moral agent, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing according to pleaſure theſe elements as ſolemnities of his grant, and they work according to the nature of the office aſſigned them, that is, by way of ſign and ſeal, for the help of our underſtandings, the refreſhing of our memories, and ſtrength of our faith in promiſes of greater things.</p>

                        <p>IN order to the diſcovery of ſome further light concerning the operation of Sacraments, and for detection of erroneous opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions about them, I ſhall lay down ſeveral Poſitions.<note place="margin">Explicatory Propoſitions. 1. Mans firſt ori<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ginal is in ſin.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Firſt, This muſt be held as an uncontroverted truth between parties in this diſpute, that <hi>Mans firſt original is in ſin, his firſt eſtate</hi> (not by Creation, but by birth, not as he came out of the hands of God, but as he comes into the world) <hi>is in full oppoſition againſt heaven, The imagination of mans heart, is evil from his youth,</hi> Gen. 8.21. The word (as <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> and <hi>Rivet</hi> on the place, with Mr. <hi>Hilderſam</hi> on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. obſerve) ſignifies infancy, the ſame title which is given to <hi>Moſes</hi> when he was new-born, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.6. Compare with this <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.3. <hi>The wicked are eſtranged from the womb, they go aſtray as ſoon as they be born, ſpeaking lyes.</hi> The ſin of all begins then, the ſin of bad men ſtill remains, no change is wrought in them, nor amendment ſeen, but a progreſſe in evil, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. <hi>Behold, I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my mother conceive me;</hi> The cavils of old Anabaptiſts to take off the force of this text are vain, That by iniquity here is not meant ſin, but ſorrow, which for ſin came upon women in child-bearing, and that by ſin in the later part of the verſe is meant the height of luſt in <hi>Davids</hi> parents. Let any man look into the context, and ſee whether it will bear any ſuch gloſſe. <hi>David</hi> is there upon a ſerious humiliation of his ſoul for ſin, and aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it in the circumſtances of it, and how his mothers ſharpe throwes in travel, or either of his parents height of luſt, can add any thing at all to aggravate his guilt, or increaſe his ſorrow,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:168215:193"/> none can underſtand, he preſently prayes that this may be cleanſed, and taken away, which can be underſtood of neither of thoſe particulars which are in the objection. This pollution by birth ſin abundantly appears in reaſon.</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <note place="margin">Arguments evincing it.</note> 1. By the neceſſity of regeneration, or new-birth in all thoſe that enter into the Kingdom of heaven. As the Apoſtle ſaith of Covenants, <hi>If the firſt had been faultleſſe, there had been no need of a ſecond,</hi> Heb. 8.7. ſo we may ſay of births; there is a neceſſity of a ſecond, therefore there was a fault in the firſt; take away this birth-ſin, or original pollution, and then you deſtroy rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. If all be as it ſhould be in our former birth, then there needs not any other.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. By the Lord Chriſts Incarnation, in order to the work of Redemption; taking mans nature, he began as man begins in ſin, even with infancy; he dyed in our nature for all, of all ſorts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and ages: infants partake of the fruit of his death, and were upon that account admitted, as his by Circumciſion, and are in Baptiſme, and are therefore under the defilement of ſin.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. By the ſtroke or judgement unto which infants are ſubject, being lyable to ſickneſſe, taken away by death, ſubject to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of all kinds; ſin goes before as the cauſe, where theſe follow as effects, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>As by one man ſin entered into the world, and death by ſin: ſo death paſſed upon all men; for that all have ſinned, or in whom all have ſinned.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. The readineſſe and proneneſſe of little ones to run upon ſin is an evidence of it. The thornes, bryars, and weeds, that the earth caſts out, when precious flowers, and choiſe plants are more hardly nouriſhed, is an argument that the earth is under a curſe, and is not now, as once it was. The ſins that even in childhood appear, and together with age grow forwards, when graces are difficultly planted, and that which is good very hardly produced, is as great an evidence of a mans innate degeneration.

                           <hi>but they muſt by no means <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> be divided; Chriſt doth not impart his merit, where he doth deny his Spirit.</hi> We account it a great preſumption in men of years, to talke of juſtification, and want ſanctification; and we can ſay to ſuch, <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi> God writes his Law in the heart, and puts it into the inward parts, where he remembers ſin no more, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33.

And it is an unwarrantable conceit to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that relative priviledges of adoption, and pardon of ſin, are conferred on infants in Baptiſme, or otherwiſe, when their natures remain ſtill the ſame and unchanged; who can think that God fits all of age for glory, that he takes into glory? and yet takes infants into glory, their impurity and birth-defilement continuing.

                           <hi>havo reſpect to this whole work, both of the change of our nature, and the removal of our guilt:</hi> As the have reſpect to the one, ſo alſo to the other; and that the whole of their work, and the way how it is wrought may be better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, we are to conſider that; Firſt, <hi>Somewhat</hi> is hinted, and implyed in thoſe reſpective ſigns of Circumciſion and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and that is our uncleanneſſe in nature, and guilt contracted upon it. Why ſhould either infant, or man of years have the foreskin of his fleſh in that way by Divine appointment cut off; but to let us underſtand the propagation of corruption, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation of it from man to poſterity? Why ſhould water be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, which is of an abſterſive, cleanſing faculty, but to let us know that there is uncleanneſſe to be removed? Cleanſing for that which is clean is vain, and needleſſe. As Sacrifices for atonement did imply wrath, ſo this cleanſing implyes filth, and conſequently guilt, filth and guilt being inſeparable.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Somewhat is ſignified and taught us in them; ſomewhat the bare ſigns themſelves are apt to ſignifie, <hi>viz.</hi> That the taking off of the ſtaine, and the removal of our guilt, is to be done by anothers power. Why is this applyed by another hand, but to let us know that it is above our ſtrength? <hi>Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what,</hi> not the ſignes of themſelves, but the Word of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that is annext teaches, and that is, That the blood of Chriſt removes this guilt, and that the Spirit of Chriſt takes away this ſtain. This the ſignes of themſelves could never ſhew, but the words of the Covenant abundantly do demonſtrate, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of guilt, is the work of the blood of Chriſt, and Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration or Sanctification, the work of the Spirit. That the water in Baptiſme holds out the Spirit unto us for Sanctification, and change of our wayes, is (that I know) denyed by none, and in the Scripture it is plain, <hi>I will circumciſe thy heart, and the heart of thy ſeed,</hi> Deut. 30.6. <hi>Circumciſion is that of the heart,</hi> Rom. 2.29. which by the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11. is interpreted the <hi>putting off the body of the ſins of the fleſh:</hi> Baptiſme is the ſame as to the ſignification, as we ſee in the ſame place, from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12, 13. <hi>In whom ye are alſo circumciſed with the circumciſion made without hands, in putting off the body of the ſins of the fleſh, by the circumciſion of Chriſt, buried with him in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, wherein ye are alſo riſen with him through the faith of the
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:168215:195"/> operation of God, who hath raiſed him from the dead, and you being dead in your ſins, and the uncircumciſion of your fleſh hath he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together with him, having forgiven all your treſpaſſes.</hi> And this death to ſin, and life in grace are both from the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11, 12, 13. and both of theſe Baptiſme holds out to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. <hi>We are buried with him by Baptiſme into his death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead, by the glory of the Father: even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſſe of life.</hi> But whether the blood of Chriſt be at all ſignified by this element of water ſome have queſtioned. Sticking ſo rigidly to that phraſe of the Apoſtle, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. that they will not alone have it underſtood of Baptiſme, but they will have nothing elſe looked after in Baptiſme, but the work of regeneration: But this doubtleſſe is a clear miſtake. The blood that was ſhed in circumciſion, gave the circumciſed to underſtand, that the guilt propagated, could not without blood be remitted. And if any think that this is too dark, and obſcure a proof of a Myſtery of this weight, let them compare with it the text under hand, and the Apoſtles ſcope and aime in it, which (as we have heard) is to ſhew, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> circumciſion was not his juſtification; ſeeing he was juſtified by faith in his ſtate of uncircumciſion, and that he received circumciſion as a ſign and ſeal of it; juſtification is by blood, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is a ſign, and ſeal of juſtification.</hi> Righteouſneſſe of faith is not Sanctification, Sanctification is inherent, the righteouſneſſe of faith is imputed; but circumciſion is a ſign, and ſeal of the righteouſneſſe of faith. And that Baptiſme ſignifies, and ſeals the ſame thing we find expreſſely in <hi>Peters</hi> words, <hi>Ast.</hi> 2.38. <hi>Be baptized every one of you in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Remiſſion of ſins is by blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhedding of blood there is no remiſſion.</hi> Baptiſme is for remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins; and therefore the water in Baptiſme holds out the blood of Chriſt. And I doubt not, but <hi>Ananias</hi> had reſpect to this in his ſpeech to <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 22.16. <hi>Riſe, and be baptized, and waſh away thy ſins. Somewhat</hi> it is, to which theſe ſigns en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, and that is all, unto which a Chriſtian in duty, as duty, ſtands engaged, whether for his change in heart or life, or in order to the pardon of his ſin. Baptiſme engages to the firſt work of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and to the firſt work of making all new within: To this circumciſion did tye; as it ſignified it, ſo it engaged to it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.16. <hi>Circumciſe the foreskin of your hearts, and be no more
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:168215:196"/> ſtiffenecked.</hi> If by vertue of their circumciſion in the fleſh, God did not require it, why is the want of it charged on <hi>Judah</hi> as their ſin? or how could it lay them open with other Nations to puniſhment? <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.25, 26. <hi>Behold, the dayes come, ſaith the Lord, that I will puniſh all them that are circumciſed, with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed,</hi> Egypt, <hi>and</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Edom, <hi>and the children of</hi> Ammon, <hi>and</hi> Moab, <hi>and all that are in the uttermoſt corners, that dwell in the wilderneſſe: for all theſe Nations are uncircumciſed, and all the houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>are uncicumciſed in the heart.</hi> And that the firſt work is required, as well as a further degree and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe, both in circumciſion and baptiſme is clear: In baptiſme we are explicitly dedicated (as the Jewes were implicitly in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion) to Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt; and therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to be ſincerely his in Covenant. But this cannot be, till a change be wrought, and we be born again from above. To this therefore we are engaged. We are engaged, to <hi>love the Lord with all our heart, with all our ſtrength;</hi> but this cannot be, while our hearts are in an unchanged condition, and therefore the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of the heart, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. is mentioned in order to this of the love of the Lord: <hi>The Lord thy God will circumciſe thine heart, and the heart of thy ſeed, to love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul;</hi> what is it but the firſt work that is called for in that of the Prophet? <hi>Make ye a new heart, and a new ſpirit,</hi> Ezek. 10.31. And in thoſe texts of the Apoſtle, <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt and ſtand up from the dead,</hi> Epheſ. 5.14. <hi>Be ye transformed by the renewing of your minds,</hi> Rom. 12.2. <hi>That ye put off concerning the former converſation, the old man</hi>—And <hi>be renewed in the ſpirit of your minds,</hi> Epheſ. 4.22, 23. Howſoever ſome of theſe Scriptures may be conceived to be directed to men in a ſtate of Regeneration, and therefore that they call not for the firſt work, but for a further progreſſe in grace, yet all of them cannot be ſo Interpreted. And there is not any of them but implyes, that where the firſt work is not done, it muſt be done; where the old man is not put off, it muſt be put off; and where the new man is not put on, it muſt be put on; where the ſpirit is not renewed, it muſt be renewed. Neither is it of force againſt this, to ſay, that the firſt work is out of our power, and that in it we are wholly paſſive, and therefore we do not in baptiſme engage to it, but God rather engages for it. To which I anſwer, Though it be out of our power, yet it is
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:168215:196"/> within the command of God, and is matter of our duty. Gods command is no rule of our ſtrength, neither is it brought down to anſwer our weakneſſe; ſo a carnall man ſhould be under no ſpiritual command, but it is a rule of our duty; what we once were, and ſtill ought to be, it commands us for to be. And though we be paſſive in the firſt work, yet we are alwaies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to be active, and aſſoon as we do receive power, we are to act. Dead <hi>Lazarus</hi> was commanded to riſe, and having pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er communicated from God, he did actually riſe and come out of the grave. There is not any promiſe of God for inherent Grace, nor any work of Grace, but it comes within our duty, and a command lies on us; as inſtance might be given, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently there is an obligation and engagement to it. Gods command and his promiſes ſtand not in oppoſition, but in ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination; and to ſay that God is engaged, and not man, is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; then all that are baptized muſt be regenerate, or elſe God fails in his engagement. Somewhat it is, that theſe ſigns ſeal, and in ſealing ratify, and confirm, and that is (as the text ſhewes) the righteouſneſſe of Faith, and conſequently all other priviledges whatſoever of like nature, that are annexed to it; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, Juſtification, Adoption, Glorification. Sacraments, as ſeals, have not (as I conceive) at leaſt immediately, and directly reference to graces, or inherent habits; but priviledges. They are (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath well obſerved) ſeales of the conditional Covenant, and ſo they muſt ſeal, whatſoever they do ſeal, on Gods terms and conditions: they ratifie mercies promiſed, on thoſe termes that the Covenant doth promiſe; now graces are the conditions, and termes of the Covenant, and mercies are promiſed upon thoſe termes: and therefore the Covenant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires them, but the Sacraments do not ratifie and ſeal them. The Sacraments as ſigns ſhew us our wants of, or wants in grace by the help of the Word, and light received from it: they point us out where ſupply may be found, they engage us to this change, to the whole of duty required from the people of God: and upon anſwer of our conſcience in this work, they ſeal, and confirm all promiſed priviledges to us. The nature, efficacy, and operation of Sacraments would be better underſtood, if that which is proper to each part, or the particular office in each relation, were better known. The ſeal in a Leaſe, as from the Leſſor, doth not ratifie the homage, that is to be done by the
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:168215:197"/> Leſſee, or the ſervice from him due; but the inheritance, or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit whatſoever, which upon condition of ſuch homage, or ſervice is conveyed. Graces are the homage, and priviledges are the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, or the inheritance; the priviledges then, and not the graces, are directly in Sacraments ſealed to us. It is not ſealed up to us; either in Baptiſme or the Lords Supper, that we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve or repent; but that believing, and repenting, we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of ſin, and ſalvation. But ſome ſay, that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſeal all that the Covenant promiſes; but the Covenant promiſes Grace, and therefore the Sacraments ſeal, and confirm in this, that we have grace. Anſw. Not to diſpute the abſolute Covenant in this place, as many call it; The Covenant to which Sacraments are annext as ſeales, properly promiſes priviledges upon condition of graces, and requires the graces though God in his elect ever graciouſly works; what it is reſpective to grace that Sacraments do, we have now heard, that is, to ſhew us our want of it, and point us out the fountain of it, engaging us to it, and upon our making good our engagements through Grace, they ratify theſe promiſed priviledges to us.</p>

                           <note place="margin">7.

The firſt are ſuch, where no Sacrament at all is mentioned, neither can it by any good argument be proved, that Sacraments in thoſe texts, are directly intended. Others are ſuch wherein Baptiſme indeed is mentioned; but faith is evidently required to the attainment of the effect there ſpecified;</hi> when theſe two are proved, a full anſwer is given to all the Scriptures which by the Adverſaries in this behalf are objected. Scriptures of the firſt rank are,<note place="margin">1. Such where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, nor can be proved that any is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> 
                           <hi>Titus</hi> 3.5. <hi>According to his mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of Regeneration,</hi> Epheſ. 5.25, 26. <hi>Chriſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Church, and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it, with the waſhing of water by the word,</hi> 1. Cor. 6.12. <hi>Such were ſome of you; but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but ye are juſtified in the Name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Though the thing ſignified in Baptiſme is here evidently ſpoken to, and ſome alluſion may be conceived to be here made to Baptiſme; yet I ſuppoſe that it can by no good argument be proved, that the Sacrament of Baptiſme in any of theſe Scriptures is intended.
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:168215:197"/> Firſt,<note place="margin">Arguments evincing that Baptiſme is not intended in the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal work of it.</note> The Lords Supper may be as fairely evidenced out of Chriſt words, <hi>John</hi> 6.53, 54, 55. <hi>Except ye eat the fleſh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you; whoſo eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day; for my fleſh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed,</hi> as Baptiſme may be evinced out of any of thoſe texts alleadged: when yet Proteſtant Writers unanimouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude, and ſeverall learned Papiſts yield, that no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall eating is there intended. To clear this they ſay, there is a meer Sacramentall eating, and drinking the fleſh and blood of Chriſt, when the outward ſigns are received, and no more; a meer ſpirituall eating and drinking, when Chriſt is applyed by faith without any Sacramentall ſign; and an eating, and drinking both Sacramental and Spirituall, when the Sacrament is received by ſincere believers; and the text in <hi>John</hi> is underſtood (as they conclude) of bare ſpiritual eating, and drinking. The ſame we may apply to waſhing, and conclude, that it is meerly ſpiritual waſhing, that in theſe texts alleadged is underſtood. Secondly, There are the ſame phraſes, or thoſe that are parallell with them, in Old Teſtament-Scriptures, when no Sacrament of this kind was inſtituted, and therefore could not be intended, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.7. <hi>Purge me with Hyſſope, and I ſhall be clean: waſh me, and I ſhall be whiter then Snow,</hi> Ezek. 36.25 <hi>Then will I ſprinckle cleane water upon you, and you ſhall be clean from all your filthineſſe.</hi> And it muſt needs be that meer Spiritual, and not Sacramentall waſhing, for the reaſon alleadged, muſt in theſe texts be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. Thirdly, If outward Baptiſme were there intended, why ſhould not the word Baptiſme be there, as in other places uſed? when we ſee it is yet omitted, when other words are in the ſtead of it induſtriouſly choſen; when common waſhing is intended, we know that the word Baptiſme is frequently uſed, as <hi>Mar.</hi> 7.8. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.38. and ſo alſo, when legall cleanſing is ſpoken to; as, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.20. And in caſe Baptiſme it ſelf were here purpoſely intended, it is marvel that other words ſhould by the Spirit of God be choſe, and this laid aſide.

And whereas ſome later Papiſts affirm, that this opinion of infuſed habits in Infants, is now otherwiſe ratified then heretofore by the authority of the <hi>Trent Councel,</hi> he firſt anſwers, that that Councel hath no

                           <hi>That all baptized infants are acquitted from the guilt of original ſin;</hi> for which opinion, many Fathers, and School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are quoted by him, as they were for the former. So that I think the firſt part of my poſition is fully made good, that the moſt eminent that ever have appeared for this power of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to conferre grace on the receivers, either utterly deny, or elſe doubtfully hold that Baptiſme works any real change in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, but onely that which is relative, and that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres, not habits, but onely priviledges on Infants bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
                        <p>For the other part of the poſition, that the Scriptures which theſe bring for proof of this power of Baptiſme, almoſt all ſpeak of ſuch a change, that is real, not relative; of habits, and not of priviledges. The proof is eaſy. What thoſe Scriptures are which by them are produced in this Controverſy, may be ſeen in the former poſition, and that almoſt all of them ſpeak of a real change, not barely that which is relative, is evident. The alone Old Teſtament text that I can find, is, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. with <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.25. where circumciſion of the heart is mentioned; which texts as they can hardly be interpreted to ſpeak at all of the Sacrament of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, in the outward rite, ſo it is certain, that a real change is ſpoken to by <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> and by the Prophet alſo complained of to be wanting.

<pb n="381" facs="tcp:168215:201"/> aſſert, Where the Spirit of Chriſt is offered on Gods part, and applyed for regeneration, and true ſanctification, and no impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment put by him that doth receive it, there regeneration, ſanctification, and all other gracious habits are wrought: But in the Baptiſme of Infants the Spirit of Chriſt is thus offered, and applyed, and no impediment is put: <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Major in this ſyllogiſme can be no more denyed, then in the former. The Spirit of Chriſt is as efficacious for regeneration, as his blood for pardon; It were over-much boldneſſe to put any difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. And for the Aſſumption, none can deny but the Spirit is as well applyed in Baptiſme, as blood; either then both muſt hold, or both muſt be denyed.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I utterly deny, that the blood and Spirit of Chriſt, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>2</label> blood or Spirit, are thus applyed in Baptiſme; In caſe of ſuch application, they would produce their effects, above, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all reſiſtance, there is no vain application of either of theſe to any perſon. If the Spirit of Chriſt had been in Baptiſme ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> it would ſo have ſeazed upon him, and wrought in him, that <hi>Peter</hi> would not have addreſſed himſelf to him in that language, which he heard from him, and ſo I may ſay of the blood of Chriſt, ſuch an application of it to his ſoul, would have had that effect, that <hi>Peter</hi> would have ſaid to him in the words of the <hi>Seraphim</hi> to <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> when he had applyed the coal from the Altar to his mouth, <hi>Thine iniquity is taken away, and thy ſin is purged;</hi> and not as he did, that <hi>thou art in the gall of bitterneſſe, and the bond of iniquity.</hi> The blood of Chriſt upon the ſoul of an Infant, or man of years, muſt needs be as efficacious as a coal from the Altar on <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s lips. Univerſal redemption, we know, is aſſerted by theſe Authors, though it be with ſuch li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, as not to cloſe with <hi>Arminians,</hi> but to remain their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite. If now there be not onely impetration of the merit of Chriſt, but alſo application in that latitude as Baptiſme is adminiſtred. I know nothing that can ſtand in the way of ſalvation, of all thoſe that are baptized. He that would ſee the conſent of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Writers, of the moſt eminent note, in the denyal of this propoſition, let him conſult learned Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> Diſcep. pap. 6, &amp;c. whereby his induſtrious pains (after his manner) many are multiplied; <hi>Danaeus</hi> leads the way, <hi>He is deceived</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that thinks that Chriſt and his benefits, are applyed by the ſign of water, which is onely the ſeal of ſuch application.</hi>

                           <pb n="382" facs="tcp:168215:202"/>3. According to theſe principles laid by theſe Authors, no guilt of ſin is taken away by Baptiſme, either in Infants, or men of years: for either it is pardoned before Baptiſme, or elſe a barre in Baptiſme is put againſt the pardon of it. If they are regenerate before Baptiſme, then ſin is pardoned before they are baptized. In caſe they are unregenerate when they are ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to Baptiſme, then there is a barre put to it. Original ſin in Infants is mortal, otherwiſe they would be ſaved without Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, as well as in it. And ſin in the unregenerate is mortal likewiſe. There are therefore barres put by both of theſe, or at leaſt an impediment found, and conſequently no mans ſin is thus remitted upon account of his Baptiſme.</p>

                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It was not with good advice, that birth-ſin, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by <hi>David,</hi> is in the Major propoſition branched out in that latitude, as to comprize both uncleanneſſe and wrath; For it makes way for the Aſſumption to be as large, namely that in Baptiſme the Spirit is promiſed, and applyed, to take away filth as well as blood, to deliver from wrath, otherwiſe the remedy doth not anſwer the malady. And ſo we have more in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion then they would have, though no more then is in the premiſes, <hi>viz.</hi> that in Infant Baptiſme there is both remiſſion of ſin, and regeneration. The Infant is thus made, both happy and inherently holy.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The fruit of Baptiſme, a right carried on, (conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>2</label> anſwering to baptiſmal engagements) is indeed forgiveneſſe of ſins: But the promiſe that place mentioned, is not remiſſion of ſins (ſuppoſedly to follow upon the act of Baptiſme), but it is that which did denominate them children of the promiſe, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 17. and continued to them who were his off-ſpring, which argued them to be yet in Covenant. And the Apoſtle makes uſe of it, as a motive to preſſe them to accept of Baptiſme, the preſent initiating ſeal
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:168215:202"/> of it. See this text further ſpoken to, Treatiſe of the Covenant, Chap. 37, 43.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, It is objected. <hi>That which Baptiſme figures, that <label type="milestone">
                                 <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>3</label> it works, otherwiſe it is a ſign that is fallacious: But Baptiſme figures out remiſſion of ſin, and the taking away the guilt of it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Baptiſme alſo figures out a further work, of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> and ſanctification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. This Propoſition univerſally underſtood, without any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>2</label> is denied on all hands. They that aſſert this Sacramental work, will have it to be with this proviſo, that no barre be put by the receivers.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Sacraments do effect what they figure, as ſeales effect what the Covenant conveyes, upon Covenant-terms, all is effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>3</label> that in Sacraments is figured. The Apoſtle tells us with what limits this propoſition holds, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The great objection is. <hi>If Sacraments have no other work <label type="milestone">
                                 <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>4</label> upon the ſoul, then by way of ſign and ſeal, as they have their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the underſtanding, and faith of the receivers, then infant baptiſme is uſeleſſe, and unprofitable; there is no end why they ſhould be baptized, ſeeing there is no work wrought, either upon their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, or faith in this ordinance, and ſo their Baptiſme is vain and needleſſe. And therefore upon this account, complaint is made by ſome friends of Infant Baptiſme, that the doctrine</hi> de nudis ſignis <hi>(as it is called) making Sacraments bare and empty ſignes, is the ground of Anabaptiſme. And the greateſt ſticklers againſt Infant Baptiſme, have publickly profeſſed, that if that tenent of the</hi> opus operatum <hi>(as we may call it) in Sacraments could be clearly proved, they would no longer oppoſe that practice.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If the doctrine <hi>de nudis ſignis</hi> were (as is objected) <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> the ground of Anabaptiſme, then I marvel how it comes to paſſe that that doctrine ceaſing, Anabaptiſme doth not ceaſe with it. I read <hi>Calvin</hi> and others (to whom in this I ſubſcribe) oppoſing it, I know none that now aſſert it. As ſoon as <hi>Calvin</hi> hath done with refutation of one, he preſently falls upon refutation of this other, I here oppoſe; It is hard to ſay, whether he be more zealous againſt the doctrin <hi>de nubis ſignis,</hi> Inſtit. lib. 4. cap. 14. Sect. 13. or againſt this other doctrine of Sacramental efficacy, Sect. 14. And <hi>Chamier,</hi> lib. 1. de Sacram. in gen. cap. 10. Sect. 11. having mentioned that uſe of Sacraments as diſtinguiſhing ſigns, ſaith,

                           <hi>This is not yet alone or chief end of them; therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we oppoſe Anabaptiſts, as well as</hi> Bellarmine; <hi>and</hi> Calvin <hi>alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him had refuted them, in that they make Sacraments nothing more then ſignes diſtinguiſhing Chriſtians from Jewes, and Pagans as a gown ſometimes was a ſign whereby a Roman was known from a Greek.</hi> I remember when in the Divinity Schools, a reſpondent in his verſes (according to cuſtome premiſed) called the ſignes in the Sacraments, <hi>ſurda elementa</hi> (it may be <hi>metri cauſâ</hi>) The Dr. of the chair made a ſharp animadverſion on it. They that do not raiſe them ſo high, as to make them inſtruments of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this nature, yet do not ſet them ſo low, as to be naked and empty ſigns. They are not naked, though ſuch clothes, that every one woul put upon them, do not fit them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It is no marvel that Anabaptiſts are ready to offer to come in to us, upon theſe terms, when this doctrine is fully cleared, being well aware, that it never will nor can be proved, and ſo they have a good ground given them to hold on in their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. Our great revilers of the place of our publick meetings, calling them by the name of Steeple-houſes, or thinking that too gentle, <hi>Jeroboams</hi> calve-houſes, I doubt not but will promiſe to forbear that language if it can be clearly proved, that they are of divine inſtitution, and that they have that holy ſanction put upon them, as once the Temple had at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> but when thoſe that put ſo high an honour upon them, riſe ſo high in their elogies, and yet fall ſo low in their proofs, they put an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into their mouthes, and (as I may ſay) an axe or hammer into their hands to demoliſh them, making them to think that this is all that can be ſaid for them. Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> in his hiſtory of holy warre, lib, 3. cap. 20. quoting out of <hi>Reinerius</hi> a charge againſt the Albigenſes, that they gave no reverence to holy pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, anſwers, <hi>It is true.</hi> And then gives in this for a reaſon, <hi>becauſe moſt in that age ran riot in adoring of Churches, as if ſome inherent holineſſe was ceiled to their roof, or plaiſtered to their walls, yea, ſuch as might more ingratiate with God the perſons and prayers of people there aſſembled.</hi> Let men take heed that they raiſe not Sacraments above the honour that Scripture gives them, with like ſucceſſe as theſe did places of publick holy aſſemblies; a good cauſe hath not a greater adverſary then a weak argument taken up in the defence of it. This argument, I confeſſe, had it ground to ſtand upon, might be of force for the battery of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſme,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:168215:203"/> but having no Scripture-bottome, it preſently falls before any adverſary, and Anabaptiſme gathers ſtrength by the fall of it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. As to the argument it ſelf, tending to evince the uſeleſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of infant-Baptiſme, it may very fitly be parallelled with that Objection, made againſt <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1. when he had made it his great buſineſſe, to ſet circumciſion on its right bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and declared, that it was not efficacious in the way that they expected, and that it was without uſe for ſalvation, unleſſe it were anſwered with the Circumciſion of the heart, an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection preſently is raiſed, <hi>What profit is there then of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?</hi> ſo theſe likewiſe when Sacraments are not raiſed to that height, as the Schoolmen have advanced them, to be inſtruments of conveyance of grace by the work done, and as they expect from them, they preſently demand, what profit? And affirm (as to infants at leaſt) that they are uſeleſſe.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That anſwer, which <hi>Paul</hi> gives to his Queſtioniſts, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> what profit is there of Circumciſion I give to thoſe that demand, what profit is there of infant-Baptiſme? Having aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in general, <hi>Much every way:</hi> he anſwers more punctually, inſtancing in one eminent priviledge, that virtually comprized all the external priviledges enjoyned by <hi>Iſrael</hi> as Church-members, <hi>chiefly that to them were committed the Oracles of God.</hi> It was ſaid before that theſe priviledges in all Sacraments, are either actually conferred or infallibly evidenced. In Baptiſme a true title is legally conferred. Upon account of our baptiſme we have an orderly and legall right, and title to all ſucceeding Church-priviledges, as the Jewes had done upon account of their Circumciſion, though there be not alwayes an aptitude for actual admiſſion to them, or improvement of them. Upon this ground infants have, 1.

As it was an acceptable work to daſh the infants of <hi>Babylon</hi> againſt the ſtones, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137.9. being a ſeed growing up againſt God; ſo it is as diſpleaſing, and provoking to harme theſe, that, are a ſeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated unto, and growing up for God. 4. Baptiſme teaches them to know as ſoon as they are of capacity to learn to whom they belong, what Maſter they are to ſerve, and in what School they are to be trained. 5. A neceſſity is ſeen to get the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt, and timely to walk in his wayes. 6. A delight is wrought in them, towards thoſe in whoſe communion they are bred, and that own them as theirs, whereas being debarred in childhood from this ſociety, and denyed this badge, it is the way to bring them to maligne them: each one is apt to love thoſe of his owne fraternity, and on the contrary to ſtudy the oppoſition of others. 7. The aggravation of their ſin preſently rings in their ears, by reaſon of the favour they receive from God, the ſociety into which they are incorporated, when their, converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth not in ſome meaſure anſwer their profeſſion. 8. Parents here ſee a ſtrong engagement, to bring them up for Chriſt, whom they have thus dedicated to him, and put into the fellowſhip of thoſe who are his Saints and members. When they have brought forth children unto God, they ſee their ſin heightned in giving them to <hi>Moloch,</hi> or any other beſides God, and there is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of any believing parent in all the Scripture bringing, up a child for Covenant, but in Covenant with the Lord. Theſe alone, though more might be added, might ſtop the mouthes of all that inſultingly move this queſtion.</p>

Dr. <hi>Slater</hi> on <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.25. hath theſe words: <hi>Here I think the obſervation is eaſie, out of the body of the text, that the work done in Sacraments availes not to righteouſneſſe or ſalvation except the condition of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant be performed by thoſe that partake them; firſt the condition, then the Antitheſis ſhewes it, if thou be a breaker of the Law, thy circumciſion is made uncircumciſion, that is all one to thee, as if thou hadſt never been circumciſed: yea, a gentile wanting the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, having obedience, is nearer heaven then thou that haſt the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament and neglecteſt obedience: and weigh well that the Lord in promiſing or ſealing binds not himſelf to performance, but conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally, that we perform our reſtipulation; and whence Sacraments ſhould have their efficacy, but from the promiſe and grace of God I ſee not.</hi> Circumciſion in the fleſh engaged the receivers to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion in the heart, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.16. where theſe did concurre, there was a man in Covenant, and upright in Covenant: And, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.25. wrath is denounced of God againſt ſeveral Nations; and the circumciſed, and the uncircumciſed, in the threat are put in equipage together, equally and alike to ſuffer. And to take off all ſcruple or offence that might be taken, there is a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction brought of Circumciſion in the fleſh, and Circumciſion in heart. <hi>Judah</hi> had Circumciſion in the fleſh to plead, but remained uncircumciſed in heart, and therefore fares no better then thoſe that were uncircumciſed in fleſh, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.4. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet commands, <hi>Circumciſe your ſelves to the Lord, and take away the foreskin of your heart, ye men of Judah, and inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>leſt my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, becauſe of the evil of your doings.</hi> On theſe terms the fury of the Lord is prevented. Thoſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that paſſed out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> into the wilderneſſe for <hi>Canaan,</hi> had the <hi>Cloud,</hi> and the <hi>Sea</hi> of the ſame uſe as Baptiſme: And <hi>Manna,</hi>

The two former are called by the name of <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> and the two latter, <hi>Spiritual meat, Spiritual drink.</hi> All were baptized in the one, and all did eat and drink of the other; yet (ſayes the text) <hi>with many of them God was not well pleaſed, for they were overthrown in the wilderneſſe.</hi> If you would know who ſuffered thus under Gods diſpleaſure, the text tells you, <hi>Luſters after evil things,</hi> v. 6. <hi>Idolaters,</hi> v. 7. <hi>Fornicators,</hi> v. 8. <hi>Tempters of Chriſt,</hi> v. 9. <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murers,</hi> v. 10.

                        <p n="1">1. In this caſe where the ſoul anſwers not to Sacramental en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, Sacraments are but as outward ſhadowes, and bare empty ſigns, and ſet out by the Spirit of God in Scripture with all their Rites and Ceremonies, (as other Ordinances of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) in the moſt low, deſpicable and undervaluing words that is poſſible. Baptiſme in the letter, is no better with the Apoſtle then <hi>putting away the filth of the fleſh;</hi> the cleanſing of the hands, the feet, or face from dirt or filth, is the ſame with it. The Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees waſhing of hands, yea, their waſhing of cups, platters, (as low as it is laid by our Saviour) was as efficacious and as accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Circumciſion alſo when it led not to, but from Chriſt, is called by the Apoſtle by the name of <hi>Conciſion,</hi> Phil. 3.2. Any gaſh made in the fleſh, or rent in the garment, as well pleaſeth. The Apoſtle therefore, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.25. ſaith, <hi>Circumciſion verily profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth if thou keep the Law, but if thou be a breaker of the Law, thy circumciſion is made uncircumciſion.</hi> If you underſtand the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaking the ſenſe of the carnal Jewes, with whom he had to deal, then you muſt underſtand the keeping of the Law in its full perfection; for to this Circumciſion, lookt upon, as a leading Law-Ceremony, did engage: <hi>He that is circumciſed is a debtor to the while Law;</hi> if we underſtand him ſpeaking of it as a ſeal of the righteouſneſſe of faith, then ſincerity is intended. If this be wanting, Circumciſion is uncircumciſion: where that of the heart is, there Circumciſion in Gods account, is; and where it is
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:168215:206"/> not, there Circumciſion is not, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29. <hi>We are the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that worſhip God in Spirit and truth,</hi> when the cutting of the foreskin in thoſe falſe teachers was no better then Conciſion, the worſhip of God in Spirit in whomſoever it was, was Circumciſion.</p>

In caſe of uncircumciſion in the time of the Law, and Non-baptiſme in theſe times, ſins were no more then tranſgreſſions of the Law; but now they are breaches of Covenant: Then they would have been meerly rebellion againſt Soveraignty, but now they are Apoſtaſie, and treacherie. In Sacraments we cloſe with God, and take his Name upon us as his ſervants; in ſin we depart from him, and refuſe to ſerve him: Thus our bond is broke, and our moſt ſolemn engagements with God made void. In Baptiſme we undertake a profeſſion of Chriſt, in wayes of ſin we are treacherous towards him and ſtand up in hoſtility againſt him. When thoſe <hi>Iſraelites, Jer.</hi> 34. had covenanted with God to put away their ſervants, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Law they had kept in bondage, and afterwards ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themſelves of them; we ſee what followes upon it, the Lord proclaims liberty to them, <hi>to the ſword, to famine and peſtilence.</hi> When we have once covenanted to put away our ſins, we have leſſe reaſon to ſerve our ſelves of them, or rather again to ſerve them, then theſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had to ſerve themſelves of their bond men and bond-women. The higheſt reproach is this way caſt upon Chriſt. No man leaves one Maſter, to betake himſelf to the ſervice of another, but he prefers in his judgement the latter before the former, eſpecially when he breaks all Bonds, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and Engagements for ſuch an exchange of ſervice. When a penitent perſon leaves ſin to come over to Chriſt, Chriſt hath honour. It appears that he is now in diſlike with ſin, and better pleaſed with Chriſt, But when a man leaves Chriſt, and his wayes to ſerve ſin, there is a reproach caſt upon Chriſt; and of this he is very ſenſible, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.5. <hi>What iniquity have your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers found in me, that they are gone from me, and walked after va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and became vain?</hi> An aſperſion of iniquity is caſt upon a Maſter, when he is left, and the vaineſt of men is choſen; and this caſt upon Chriſt in the higheſt way in a Chriſtians turning to ſin, and in this caſe we ſee in what manner he expoſtulates and complaines.</p>

This reſtipulation of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience being no other then Sanctification, and Sanctification the impreſſion that the Spirit makes by way of ſeal, when we are not onely not aſſured of this work of the Spirit, but aſſuredly want it, then our want of intereſt in Chriſt is evident: for if any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.

Now the Covenant hath penalties as well as promiſes, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as well as mercies, conſcience anſwering to Covenant-engagements, they are intereſted in mercies, conſcience witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the contrary, they neceſſarily become lyable to judgements, and therefore the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>He that eats and drinks unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, eats and drinks judgement to himſelf.</hi> That very kind of eating hath an obligation in it to ſuffering, and the equity of ſuch obligation, by ſuch a communicant is acknowledged. If an idle, unfaithful, purloyning, run-away apprentice, ſhould bear ſtripes from his Maſters hand, and ſhould upon it, produce his Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to implead his Maſter for reparations, theſe Indentures will give full evidence to the juſtice of his ſufferings, or a man that enjoyes a leaſe with ſeveral clauſes of forfeiture, and by non-payment of rent, or otherwiſe makes forfeiture, the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of his leaſe for ratification of his title proves a nullifying and deſtruction of it: This is the caſe of an unbelieving, impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, diſobedient Chriſtian.

Some ſay, What if <hi>David</hi> had dy'd after his adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, before his recovery? what then had been his caſe? He was a child of God, and could a child of God have periſhed?

He that can reconcile one of theſe, may be able eaſily to reconcile them both. An Elect perſon cannot be damned, and an enemy of Chriſt cannot be ſaved. A Child of God cannot dye, and a Murderer and Adulterer cannot live. We find therefore, that <hi>Paul</hi> did not dye in his Perſecution; he that choſe him to life, choſe him alſo to the acknowledgment of the truth. <hi>David</hi> did not dye in his Adultery; He that had adopted him for glory, wrought him to repentance for remiſſion of ſins.

He ſhall not enter into condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet he is not taken out of the hands of diſcipline; ſee <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57.17, 18. <hi>For the iniquity of his covetouſneſſe was I wroth, and ſmote him; I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart. I have ſeen his wayes, and will heal him, I will lead him alſo, and reſtore comforts to him, and to his mourners;</hi> Theſe of whom the Prophet here ſpeaks, were a people of Gods everlaſting love, being thoſe whom he heals, and to whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores comforts. They were yet overmuch carried out to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe, and purſuit of creature contentments; Gods wrath was upon them for this miſcarriage of theirs, he was moved here upon to appear in diſpleaſure againſt them; he ſmites them in his wrath, and hides his face in diſpleaſure from them, having his eye open to their ſin, but his face withdrawn from their conſolation. <hi>Num.</hi> 20.13. we may find <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aarons</hi> ſin, and the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> obſervation upon it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.32, 33. <hi>They angred him alſo at the waters of ſtrife, ſo that it went ill with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for their ſakes; becauſe they provoked his ſpirit, ſo that he ſpake unadviſedly with his lips.

The thing that <hi>David</hi> did, diſpleaſed the Lord; and that it was no otherwiſe in New-Teſtament-times is clear. As the oneneſſe and ſameneſſe of the Covenant which we and they were under, doth evince it; ſo alſo Gods dealings with the <hi>Corinthians</hi> upon their prophanation of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is a proof of it.</p>

                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Poſition </seg>4</label> and ſalvation, that there lyes a neceſſity on the ſoul to come in by repentance, and by prayer to make application to the throne of grace, in order to pardon and forgiveneſſe. This is Gods way to bring his into the wayes of ſalvation and life, when they have ſtept aſide into the wayes of death. To this end God keeps up Diſcipline with his own hand, as we may ſee, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31, 32. The Apoſtle having there reproved theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> in a tart way for prophanation of the Lords Supper, and diſſwaded them from it by the deadly nature of the crime, they were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>guilty of the body and blood of the Lord,</hi> and the danger they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, <hi>eating and drinking judgement to themſelves;</hi> he farther ſets before them preſent experiments of Gods hand, <hi>For this cauſe many are weak, and ſickly among you, and many ſleep;</hi> In this place he lets them know how they might avoid this judgement, <hi>If we would judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged.</hi> Our examination and ſentence might avert the examination and ſentence of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And then acquaints them with Gods end in this viſit of his, to correct as a Father, and not condemn as a Judge: <hi>But when we are judged, we are chaſtened of the Lord, that we ſhould not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with the world.</hi> The application here is eaſie, They are the Elect of God, and of ſaving Goſpel intereſt, that are kept from condemnation. A way in ſin would have brought them, as others in the world, into condemnation: If they might have been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in ſin, when the world was damned for ſin, this correction for that end did not need. To avoid condemnation therefore for ſin, God by his judgements laſhes them out of it: <hi>By this ſhall the iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit, to take away his ſin.</hi> So that the tendency of ſin, even in a child of God, is to bring to condemnation; and the care of God is by afflictions to take him off from ſin, that he might not be condemned. To this end Church-diſcipline is alſo ſet up of God, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.3, 4, 5. <hi>For I verily as abſent in body, but preſent in ſpirit, have judged already as though I were preſent, concerning him that hath ſo done this deed, in the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when ye are gathered together, and my ſpirit, with the power of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to deliver ſuch a one unto Satan, for the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the ſpirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> How farre that ſentence of giving up to Satan did reach, I ſhall not ſtand to determine, whether barely to caſt him out of the Church,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:168215:210"/> and put him among thoſe over whom Satan reigned, or as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of it, horrors and terrors from Satan by Gods juſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; when the Church leaves him off from their communion, God caſts him off from his protection and conſolation: which (as is ſaid) ordinarily followed upon this ſentence in Primitive times: The end is plain, <hi>the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> If this mans for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer juſtification would have brought him on in his ſin without ſtep to ſalvation, all this had not needed, that his ſpirit might be ſaved. See further, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9. the Apoſtles ſevere dealings with theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> concerning this inceſtuous member, had caſt them down with grief, and this grief raiſed the Apoſtles ſpirit with joy, not that they had grieved, but that their grief had ſo happy an iſſue. <hi>Now I rejoyce not,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that ye were made ſorry, but that ye ſorrowed to repentance,</hi> adding, ver. 10. <hi>For godly ſorrow works repentance to ſalvation not to be repented of.</hi> They were ſtepping therefore out of the ſalvation-way, repentance brings them back This in reaſon is plain; If new ſins thus committed oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion no ſuch obſtruction, as to bring a neceſſity of repentance, (as ſome would have it) then the free grace of God gives a man full liberty to ſin, &amp; opens a gap to all ungodlineſſe; this will then follow, which ſome have prophanely inferred from ſome Goſpel-principles, Live as I liſt, and ſhall be ſaved. What ſhall hinder, if no way in ſin either hath any tendency to condemnation, or is any obſtruction in the way of ſalvation? Some I know to avoid this, ſpeak of that holy, filial, ingenuous diſpoſition in a child of God, that in caſe he were ſet free from any ſuch danger, and let looſe to all the devils in hell; he would abhor ſin, and have in deteſtation all that is evil, but I do not find God giving in his teſtimony of any ſuch ingenuity. If all the children of God were thus towardly, all thoſe rods that he uſes were needleſſe; and if juſtification might be thus carried on in ſin, Chriſt would not have found reaſon to have ſaid, <hi>Straight is the gate, and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is the way that leadeth to life,</hi> Matth. 7.14. It was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently broad in caſe ſin would lead us in at it. Neither would the Apoſtle have ſaid, <hi>If the righteous ſcarcely be ſaved, where ſhall the ungodly and the ſinner appear?</hi> 1 Pet 4.18. The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous might thus be ſaved with eaſe, and the wicked and ſinners ſalvation would be alike eaſie.</p>
                        <p>Theſe in this poſture under the preſent power of luſt or temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,

Their Baptiſm-Vow is not as it ought kept up, and their adventure to come to the Lords Table for renewing of their Covenant, (the ſtrength of luſt ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) is a further provocation of the Lord. Upon this account the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> (as we have heard) ſmarted. God will not bear ſo high a diſhonour of ſo great an Ordinance. It is an high preſumption for a ſoul, under ſuch preſent defilements; to dare to approach ſo nigh his preſence, otherwiſe then in order to humiliation, and more ſtrict renewed engagements againſt ſuch practices. He that comes in this poſture might here ſee the hatefulneſſe of his preſent way to the height ſet out, and the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the heavyeſt, ſmarteſt ſtroke, that can be laid. As <hi>Joab</hi> ſometimes abominated a ſin that <hi>David</hi> acted, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.6. though <hi>David</hi> was a man in the general frame of his ſoul, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right with God, and <hi>Joab</hi> (as we may fear) far from it; ſo ſome that never had that change on their heart, yet under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent convictions, and reſolutions againſt ſin, with the Publican, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. and intelligent in the wayes of God with that Scribe <hi>that was not far from the Kingdome of heaven,</hi> Mark 12.34. may be otherwiſe accepted at the Lords Table, then theſe perſons notwitſtanding their habitual graces.</p>

A man of dimme ſight, whether through want of abilities to apprehend or helps vouchſafed to underſtand, is under an unavoidable impoſſibility to reach that exactneſſe which others much above them in light may compaſſe; ſo that one Rule will not ſerve to diſcover the weakneſſe of all, <hi>but to whom much is given, of him God will require the more.</hi> Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly diſpoſed ſouls walk up to that which they know, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attain to that which they ſee not.

Temptations of this kind are of two ſorts, ſome from within, from mens natural conſtitution and temper. It is above poſſibility for ſome men to be in that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure free from all appearance and evidence of covetouſneſſe, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, lightneſſe, paſſion or the like, as ſome others. He is not fartheſt from weakneſſe, in whom leaſt appears of ſailings; but he that is leaſt vigilant, and makes leaſt reſiſtance. There are many of choiſe principles, that yet by reaſon of the temper of their natures are men of ſtrong temptations.

It is hard for theſe by the help of much grace to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in their walk equall to thoſe that are in grace farre their inferiours. As there are temptations from within, ſo there are aſſaults from without in like manner. Satan hath more free ſcope, and rope-length given him towards ſome, then towards others; and at ſometimes more towards the ſame perſons, then at other times; in which <hi>Job</hi> is an eminent example, Commiſſion after Commiſſion is given to Satan againſt him, the later ſtill exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the former. The world with more impetuous violence ſets upon ſome, then others, and at ſome times with greater violence then at others. <hi>The proud have had me greatly in deriſion, yet have I not declined from thy Law,</hi> Pſal. 119.51. <hi>The bands of the wicked have robb'd me, but I have not forgotten thy Law,</hi> Pſal. 119.61. It is a very hard thing in ſuch a caſe for a man to ſtand ſteady and upright. He that ſtands on an hill to take view of a fight, may ſee many diviſions from military rules; but in caſe he were to manage the fight, he might perhaps make more faults then he diſcovers. A ſheep hardly paſſes without loſſe of ſome wool through many briars.</p>

But when there is opportunity offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and much reaſon from conſcience heard, more regard is then had to ſelf, and leſſe to God, in caſe ſin be committed.

The prodigal is an inſtance of the Fathers readineſſe to receive to mercy thoſe that have gone away from him in wayes of ſin; And the Prophet tells us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.21, 22. <hi>If the wicked will turn from all his ſins that he hath committed, and keep all my ſtatutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not dye.

And this caveat is no more then needs, ſeeing men in all times have been wonderfully apt to delude themſelves upon account of their fruition of outward Church-priviledges;<note place="margin">Mens aptneſſe to delude themſelves in Sacramental priviledges.</note> and in particular, Sacrament-priviledges. And to this they are induced by divers reaſons. 1. Becauſe Sacraments are an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which God hath vouchſaf'd to his people, and denyed to others that ſtand not in that relation, and they cannot think
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:168215:214"/> that it is in vain, that ſuch an honour is conferred upon them. 2. There are great promiſes annext to them, and made to thoſe that make right improvement of them. The bread is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the body, and the wine in the Lords Supper the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the blood of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 10.16. It is the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament in Chriſts blood ſhed for many for the remiſſion of ſins, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.28. Baptiſme ſaves through the reſurrection of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. As many as have been baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. Inſomuch that we have been taught that in Baptiſme we are made children of God, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, and inheriters of the Kingdom of heaven; Theſe promiſes are ſtreight applied; without any eye had to the terms and Propoſitions annext to them, like unto men that look at dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities in offices, and never regard the burthens. 3. Intereſt in Sacraments is not onely a priviledge, but a duty; not onely an honour, but a work of obedience in them that partake of them. To be baptized with water, and to eat of the Bread, and drink of the Cup in the Lords Supper, is a duty, as it was to be circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the fleſh of the foreskin, and to eat the Paſchal Lambe at the time appointed, and there is danger in neglect of theſe: This gives ſome eaſe, and ſpeaks ſome peace to the conſcience, that they have done the Command of the Lord. 4. They are yet matters of eaſe, eſpecially New-Teſtament-Sacraments; Here is no mortification of the members, no crucifying of the fleſh, no cutting off the right hand, or plucking out the right eye; and therefore no marvel that men could wiſh that all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion were in them, and hope that ſalvation may be gained by them. Laſtly, Thoſe of theſe conceits, have alwayes met with teachers to ſooth them up in them,<note place="margin">In all Ages ſome have over-highly advanced Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges.</note> and carry on their deluſion. How high was Circumciſion ſet up in the Apoſtles times, as in regard of the neceſſity of it, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.1. <hi>Certain men which came down from Judea, taught the brethren and ſaid, Except ye be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed after the manner of Moſes ye cannot be ſaved:</hi> So alſo in regard of the power and efficacy of it? and therefore the Apoſtle was put to it to warn men in that way of the deluſion, and to give that undervaluing term of conciſion to it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.2. After-age produced Schoolmen, and Popiſh Writers to magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them, affixing, and limiting ſalvation (except in ſome caſes extraordinary) to the water in Baptiſme; and how great things they aſcribe to the body of Chriſt received, if no barre be put,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:168215:214"/> (which they underſtand of the Sacramental bread) is very well known. But as ſome have obſerved, where poyſon growes, providence takes care that there be antidotes found, ſo none of theſe ever appeared in the Church, but ſome by the good hand of God have ſtood up in oppoſition. How mightily did the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> oppoſe himſelf againſt that over-high opinion that the Jewes in his time had of Circumciſion? <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.25, 26. As alſo <hi>Paul,</hi> making uſe of his authority againſt the Jewes in his time, and diſputing at large againſt it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> foreſeeing (it ſeems) that Baptiſme would be ſet up as high among Chriſtians as ever Circumciſion was among the Jewes, makes it his buſineſſe to prevent it. Having affirmed that Baptiſme ſaves, he is careful to let us know that it is not by its own power, but by the reſurrection of Chriſt, that is, Faith in the Reſurrection: and further explains himſelf, that it is not the outward act alone, but as anſwered with an inward work that hath that power, as you have heard. And Popiſh School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men making it their work (as we have heard) to advance Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to that height, Proteſtant Writers in a ſull ſtream have appeared to ſet them on their right bottome, and to make it appear what it is that Scripture attributes to them, and what in their right uſe may be expected from them. <hi>Calvin</hi>'s words, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>inſtit. cap.</hi> 14. <hi>Sect.</hi> 14. are high and notable, having oppoſed the doctrine of <hi>nuda ſigna,</hi> which makes Sacraments to be bare and naked ſigns: <hi>On the other hand</hi> (ſaith he)<note n="b" place="margin">Rurſum ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monendi ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, ut iſti vim Sacramento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum enervant, uſumq prorſus evertunt, ita ab adverſâ parte ſtare alios qui arcanas neſcio quas virtures Sacramentis affingunt, quae nuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam illis à Deo inſitae leguntur.

                           <hi>we are to be advertis'd, that as thoſe weaken the efficacy of Sacraments, and utterly overthrow their uſe, ſo there are others on the other hand that aſſign I know not what vertue to them, ſuch that we never read that God ever put into them: which errour</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:168215:215"/> deceives the ſimple, and unlearned; Whileſt they are taught to ſeek the gifts of God where they cannot be found, they are by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees drawn from God to imbrace meer vanity inſtead of truth. For the Schooles of Sophiſters with great conſent have taught that the Sacraments of the new law, (that is, thoſe that are now in uſe among Chriſtians) do Juſtifie, and confer grace, provided that we put no barre of mortal ſin. Which opinion</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath been of more deadly danger than can be ſpoken: and ſo much the more, becauſe for many Ages, to the great loſſe of the Church, it hath prevailed. It is certainly</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>devilliſh; for whileſt it promiſeth Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication without Faith, it caſts ſoules headlong to deſtruction. And upon that account, becauſe they derive the cauſe of righteouſneſſe or Juſtification from the Sacraments; by this ſuperſtition they ſo enſnare the poor ſoules of men, (over-much of their own accord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to earth) that they had rather reſt in a corporeall element than in God himſelf.</hi> This is his entrance upon the diſpute. That which he hath further upon it, in four whole Sections is very well worth the reading. The conſent of other Writers of his time, and that have followed after him, as a cloud of witneſſes, might be produced: but this (as the Reader hath heard) is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done to my hand. And when ſome of reverend eſteem, and ſingularly deſerving in the Church of God, have gone over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much on this hand, as ſoon as it was carried abroad in Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts, a learned Manuſcript of Mr. <hi>Gatakers</hi> met with it, and afterwards appearing in print as a <hi>Poſthumous</hi> work, this, as ſoon as it came to the Authors cognizance by his zeal to the truth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it. And let me here adde to that which hath been ſaid, that if nothing elſe, yet experience might correct this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>high conceit of the work of Sacraments. That which we evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſee is not wrought by Sacraments, we cannot believe they are aſſign'd of God to work. This Propoſition hath certainly reaſon in it; They certainly do that office, which God hath aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd and appointed them. But we evidently ſee that they do not actually work all that they figure out, even where (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theſe) there is no bar put; therefore there is no cauſe to believe that they are deſign'd of God for it. Here I might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in their failing in the work of remiſſion of ſin in Infants, ſeeing when they come to growth we oft ſee them in that way of ſin, that ſtands not with actual forgiveneſſe. But I know that many that here are adverſaries confeſſe an interciſion of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:168215:215"/> and therefore this is not againſt them: and others that admit not that doctrine ſpeak of a double Juſtification, one, for the ſtate of Infancy; another of thoſe that are of growth upon their acceptation of Chriſt by faith: and therefore though ſins be remitted in Infancy, and afterward, upon their acting of ſin, charged, here is no ſuch interciſion of juſtification, which Arminians hold, and their adverſaries oppoſe. I ſhall therefore wave this, and inſtance in the failing of Baptiſme in the work of regeneration, which is as well figured out in Baptiſme, as that other of remiſſion of ſin. Baptiſme comes not alone to remove the guilt; but alſo to correct the power of original corruption, and ſo to work in us a freedome from the power of ſin, as well as the pardon of it. And in caſe Baptiſme effects this work, how is it that ſin in Infants is ſo apt to ſhew it ſelf? that as ſoon as they act, they are ſo readily prone to act that which is evill. When <hi>Saul</hi> ſaid he had done the Commandment of the Lord, <hi>Samuel</hi> had a confutation ready; <hi>What means then</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>this bleating of ſheep, and lowing of oxen in mine ears that I hear?</hi> 1 Sam. 15.14. If Gods command had been done, a ſheep had not been left to bleat, or an oxe to low in his hearing. Here is a real confutation as ready; If Infant-baptiſme cleanſes from original ſin, the root being dead, what means ſuch abundance of living, lively branches? How come all thoſe complaints of the timely growth of ſin in Chriſtians children? Why have not Paedobaptiſts found a real confutation of their Adverſaries in their iſſue? being able to ſhew them their young ones, as averſe from ſin as a fiſh is to a life in the ayr, when the children of their adverſaries wanting that nature-healing medicine, are wholly addicted to it. Neither Iſraelites nor Chriſtians were ever able to hold out ſuch an experiment. And if this were our received doctrine, it would neceſſarily herein infinitely ſtrengthen Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſme; when Anabaptiſts have ever found the greateſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition from their pens, that never acknowledged any ſuch power in Sacraments. And in caſe it ſhould fall out, that our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were in the truth, and we in an errour, concerning this power in Sacraments, I cannot poſſibly ſee what great danger can any way follow to us upon it, ſeeing that if Sacraments confer grace, this way, ſo far above our expectation, we among others ſhall yet have our ſhares in it. Our Infants are in no ſuch errour with us, and they put no more bar to the working of Baptiſme, then
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:168215:216"/> the Infants of others. And therefore all benefits which thus follow upon Baptiſme, are theirs. And we urge all of growth to ſee that their conſciences anſwer to all Covenant, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental engagements; which in caſe it be done, will acquit them from putting any bar to any ſuch ſuppoſed work. As a man that takes a medicine, not underſtanding the worth of it, ſhall have equal benefit with him that moſt mightily extols it: ſo we, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Infancy or Age, notwithſtanding any ſuch ignorance ſhall reap this unexpected benefit by either of both of the Sacraments. Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> (who delivers himſelf in that manner touching the efficacy of Sacraments, that a man cannot tell on what part he ſtands) <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Eccleſ. pol. Sect.</hi> 57. ſaith, <hi>It greatly offendeth, that ſome when they labour to ſhew the uſe of the holy Sacraments, aſſign unto them no end, but onely to teach the mind by other ſenſes, that which the Word doth teach by hearing. Whereupon how eaſily neglect and careleſſe regard of ſo heavenly myſteries may follow, we ſee in part by ſome experience had of thoſe men with whom that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is moſt ſtrong. For where the Word of God may be heard, which teacheth with much more expedition, and more full explication any thing we have to learn; if all the benefit we reap by Sacraments be inſtruction, they which at all times have opportunity of uſing the better means to that purpoſe, will ſurely hold the worſe in leſſe eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi> To this I may well anſwer; 1. I know not who thoſe be, that have given offence that way; They at whom this learned Authour is apt to take exceptions, and moſt profeſſedly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, do not limit the uſe of Sacraments within ſo narrow a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, as barely to teach the mind, or help the underſtanding, that is not, according to them, their whole work. As they are ſigns, they have a twofold other uſe. 1. As marks of diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſeparate Gods own from ſtrangers. 2. As bonds of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God, ſtrict obligations to the mutual exerciſe of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian charity, provocations to godlineſſe, preſervations from ſin. The Authour himſelf layes down both of theſe; and I ſcarce think that in this, he hath ever been excepted againſt by any. As ſeales, they have a further work upon the will, for the ſtrengthening of our Faith, in aſſured confidence of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as our Authour hath likewiſe obſerved. <hi>In regard of the weakneſſe that is in us, they are warrants</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for the more ſecurity of our belief.</hi> 2. I ſay, they read the Scriptures with little heed, and it may be feared, as little benefit, that do not
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:168215:216"/> conſcienciouſly make uſe of all thoſe helps, to which Scriptures lead; and that they lead to the uſe of Sacraments is evident. 3. If that the Word and Sacrament were two diſtinct teachers without reference one to the other, and it were left to my choyce which to take, I ſhould make uſe of the better, and leave the more inferiour. If I ſhould be neceſſitated to take the one, and leave the other, the Word ſhould be choſen. But ſeeing that the Sacraments are an appendant to the Word, given us in charge there, and the whole uſe of them by the Word is taught, no man can conſcienciouſly uſe the one, in neglect of the other. But let us ſee whether that which the Authour himſelf delivereth be not as much offenſive, as this at which he ſeems ſo greatly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Having laid down 3. ſeveral uſes of Sacraments, he addes, <hi>But their chiefeſt force and vertue conſiſteth not herein ſo much, as that they are heavenly Ceremonies, which God hath ſanctified, and ordained to be adminiſtred in his Church, firſt as marks, whereby to know when God doth impart the vitall or ſaving grace of Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all that are capable thereof; and ſecondly as meanes conditionall which God requireth in them unto whom he imparteth grace. For ſith God is in himſelf inviſible, cannot by us be diſcerned work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, therefore when it ſeemeth good in the eyes of his heavenly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that men for ſome ſpeciall intent and purpoſe ſhould take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his glorious preſence, he giveth them ſome plain and ſenſible token whereby to know what they cannot ſee. For Moſes to ſee God and live was impoſſible, yet Moſes by fire, knew where the glory of God extraordinarily was preſent. The Angel by whom God indued the waters of the pool of Betheſda with ſupernatural vertue to heal, was not ſeen of any, yet the time of the Angels preſence known by the troubled motions of the waters themſelves. The Apoſtles by fiery tongues which they ſaw were admoniſhed, when the Spirit, which they could not behold, was upon them. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it is with us: Chriſt and his holy Spirit, with all their bleſſed effects, though entring into the ſoul of man, we are not able to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend or expreſſe how, do notwithſtanding give notice of the times when they uſe to make their acceſſe, becauſe it pleaſed Almighty God to communicate by ſenſible means thoſe bleſſings which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible.</hi> Who would not wiſh that theſe elegancies might univerſally hold, and that as ſure as <hi>Moſes</hi> knew that God was extraordinarily preſent in the burning buſh, and the diſeaſed in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> knew that the Angel was preſent when the
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:168215:217"/> waters were moved, and the Apoſtles that the Spirit was come down, when they ſaw the fiery cloven tongues; ſo in receiving of the Sacramental ſignes, we might as aſſuredly know, that vital, and ſaving grace is imparted to us, and that theſe ſenſible meanes do as aſſuredly communicate theſe incomprehenſible bleſſings. But ſeeing thoſe marks of diſtinction between the viſible people of God, and thoſe that are ſtrangers to him, work no otherwiſe, as to vitall and ſaving grace, than hath been ſpoke, let us take heed leſt theſe diſſimilitudes do not draw us to imbrace a cloud inſtead of <hi>Juno,</hi> when it ſhall appear that they have not ſo much of elegancy, but are anſwered with equal incongruity. If they be ſuch marks as theſe inſtances ſeem to hold out to us, how are they then conditional means, to communicate theſe bleſſings? Upon what condition I marvel was it that <hi>Moſes</hi> knew that God was in the buſh? Or the Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel was in the water? Or the Apoſtles, that the Spirit was come down upon them? Theſe were undoubtedly to be lookt upon as unconditionate communications of the reſpective preſence of God, his Angel, and his Spirit. And how this ſtands with that which preſently after we find in our Authour, I know not, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe many grains be allowed to abate the height of them) that <hi>Sacraments are not Phyſical, but moral inſtruments of ſalvation, duties of ſervice and worſhip, which unleſſe we perform as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of grace requireth, they are unprofitable. For all receive not the grace of God which receive the Sacraments of his grace. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> undoubtedly did enjoy the preſence of the Angel, and the Apoſtles the preſence of the Holy Ghoſt. Let us then learn to uſe them, as the Authour of grace requireth, and that is as ſigns and ſeales, as his choſen veſſel to convey his grace here tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall onely adde in this place. If Sacraments work as ſignes and ſeales, then they muſt be allowed to have that whole work on all that are Communicants, which as ſignes and ſeales they can poſſibly effect, either for the bettering of their underſtanding, or farther engagements in wayes of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and that by the help of the Word, they may help the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding even of unregenerate perſons, and make diſcovery of ſtrong engagements to wayes of godlineſſe, can ſcarce be queſtioned. If the Word can teach the unregenerate by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then the Sacraments being appointed for viſible teaching-ſignes,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:168215:217"/> by the help of the Word may alſo teach them by ſeeing, and unregenerate men making profeſſion of their relation to God, may here ſee further engagements and provocations to godlineſſe. This effect cannot be denyed to be poſſible in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, as ſigns, at leaſt upon ſome perſons in unregeneration; and when they further ſee all the glorious priviledges of the Covenant, upon the terms propounded of God to be attainable, may they not be of ſingular uſe as ſeales to put them on, and ſtirre them up in all conſciencious uſe of means to riſe up to the anſwer of conſcience? And ſo as the Word as an inſtrument in Gods hand, by inſtructions, motives, exhortations and other provocations is a means for converſion; ſo may the Sacraments as appendents to the Word, and by the help of it be herein ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable likewiſe, which is the whole that I do or ever did attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to Sacraments, ſo much as in a poſſible way, of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>

                        <p>THe whole uſe and office of Sacraments we have ſeen,<note place="margin">Sacraments are ſuitable to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants.</note> which is to ſeal the gift and grant of God in Covenant, as well as to ſignifie. The thing ſealed in them here comes to be ſpoken to, which is the righteouſneſſe of faith. There being a double Covenant given of God to man, one in mans integrity, whileſt he was in ſpiritual life, for preſervation in life; the other in mans fallen condition when dead, for reſtitution to life. There is a double righteouſneſſe anſwering to this double Covenant: The one inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in man, to be wrought by himſelf, and called our own righteouſneſſe; The other wrought by a Mediatour in our ſtead, and made ours by Faith, and therefore called the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of faith, and ſometimes the righteouſneſſe of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrought by Chriſt who is God. And anſwerably to this double Covenant, and double righteouſneſſe, Sacraments of a double kind were inſtituted. The firſt without reſpect had to any Mediatour, confirming Gods engagements, on the terms of perfect obedience. The other with reſpect to a Mediatour, and
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:168215:218"/> Faith in him; confirming happineſſe to believers. The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Covenant of grace are of this latter ſort. They are ſigns and ſeales, as were the trees of life, and of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and evil, and ſeales of righteouſneſſe, as they were alſo, but of righteouſneſſe of another kind. The former were ſeales of the righteouſneſſe of works; Theſe are ſeales of the righteouſneſſe of faith. Thoſe were ſeales to aſſure a reward to our own righteouſneſſe; Theſe are ſeales to aſſure us of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others righteouſneſſe, made ours by faith. From hence theſe two Obſervations follow; one implyed, the other in the words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt. The firſt which is implyed in the words, is,
<q>The righteouſneſſe of Faith is the great Promiſe of the Covenant of Grace.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Apoſtle tells us of blindneſſe that in part happened to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Rom. 11.25. and the blindneſſe was this, that they would not be brought to an acknowledgment of this righteouſneſſe; But in an high zeal made it their buſineſſe to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.2, 3. It do's not appear that they wholly denyed the concurrence of all grace for the work of this righteouſneſſe in which they confided. The Phariſee, who is brought in to perſonate thoſe of this opinion, ſaith, <hi>God I thank thee, I am not like other men;</hi> He therefore did acknowledge ſome kind of diſcriminating grace; But it was his own act, thorow grace, a righteouſneſſe inherent, and not through grace impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; wrought by himſelf, and not by another in his ſtead, in which he confided. This obſervation might have been perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently and properly ſpoken to, in this place, being that on which the Sacraments are bottomed; A flaw here muſt needs be the undoing of all. The Jew miſtaking here was at loſſe of all his pains, in ſacrifices, Sacraments and all other perſonal perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances. When he had carried on this with the greateſt vigour, and alacrity; he was ſtill too ſhort, and this held him back that he look't not after any other righteouſneſſe, and ſo periſhed without any ſuch righteouſneſſe as was able to juſtifie. I ſhould not therefore have wholly paſt this by, but that a long expected and greatly deſir'd Treatiſe on this ſubject is ſent to the Preſſe, and will for a good ſpace of time prevent this piece, where the Reader, I doubt not, will find full ſatisfaction. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wholly paſſe it by, and come to the Obſervation which the words expreſly hold out.</p>

<pb n="417" facs="tcp:168215:219"/> the ſoul, producing any act beyond its ſelf, as the hand is the inſtrument to the ſoul in labour, but as receiving, and taking in a gift from God.

But theſe are made directly oppoſite one to the other, and not confounded one with the other, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5, 6. Faith therefore is conſidered not as a work or habitual grace in the ſoul: So conſidered it is a branch of our own righteouſneſſe; but as an inſtrument applying Chriſt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting us in his righteouſneſſe.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Poſitions being premiſed,<note place="margin">The Point proved.</note> the Obſervation may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily proved, that the righteouſneſſe of faith, or the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God by faith, is ſealed in the Sacraments of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, and may be made good in an induction of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. Circumciſion, the leading Sacrament of the old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is expreſly here ſpoken to, and here we ſee what is the thing ſignified in it, and ſealed by it. And in caſe we ſaw no more in it, then the moſt carnal amongſt the Jewes ſaw, that it was a note of diſtinction between them, and others that had no viſible relation to God in Covenant, yet we know that this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction was grounded and founded in Chriſt.<note place="margin">By Scriptures.</note> The one ſtood in a viſible relation to him, and the other were ſtrangers from him. And the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12. is full in the proof of it. Having ſaid, that we are compleat in Chriſt, enjoying him we want nothing, it might be objected, that we want the very lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ordinance which receives a people into viſible Communion with God, which was Circumciſion; The Apoſtle anſwers, <hi>that in him we are circumciſed, with the circumciſion made without hands, in putting off the body of the ſins of the fleſh by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of Chriſt.</hi> This, Circumciſion did figure, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29. And this is the work of Chriſt, as we ſee in the Apoſtles words, and therefore circumciſion led to him.</p>
                        <p>For the following Sacrament of the Paſſeover, if we look to the letter of the inſtitution, together with the explication given, we ſhall find it a memorial of a temporal mercy. <hi>It is the Lords Paſſeover,</hi> Exod. 12.11. that is, a memorial that the Lord paſſed
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:168215:220"/> over them when he ſmote the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> v. 13. But this is no concluding Argument, that it ſealed not Chriſt, or the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Chriſt by faith, as may (God willing) be made to appear when we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak of the Cloud, that guided <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Sea that they paſſed through, and Manna and the rock whereof they ate and drank. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance celebrated in the Paſſeover was in and through Chriſt, as is gathered from the blood that was to be ſtruck on the two ſide-poſts, and on the upper door-poſt of their houſes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.7. But moſt clearly from the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.9. He there ſayes <hi>they tempted Chriſt;</hi> but they tempted him, from whom they had defence, and preſent deliverance: And therefore the Apoſtle expreſly calls the Paſchal Lamb by the Name of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. <hi>For even Chriſt our Paſſeover is ſacrificed for us.</hi> And <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> had reſpect to it as well as to other Sacrifices of the Law, when pointing out Chriſt, he ſaid, <hi>Behold, the Lamb of God which taketh away the ſins of the world,</hi> Joh. 1.29.

Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was inſtituted for confirmation of it, and put (as we ſee in the Text) as a ſeal to it.

And that Chriſt is the great Promiſe for bleſſedneſſe in the Covenant, and that in him all Covenant-promiſes are made good, needs not to be proved. Chriſt therefore is ſealed in the Sacraments.</p>

If there be thouſands of things made over in any grant, one ſeal is the confirmation of all; and though the ſeales be many, (as <hi>Ameſius</hi> obſerves) yet all that is paſſed in Covenant is made good in each. Our Juſtification, Adoption, Perſeverance, Glorification, and whatſoever elſe in order to theſe or any of theſe, a people upright in Covenant may expect from the hand of God, is under ſeal, in every Sacrament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd unto them. So that, whatſoever it is that the Word pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth, that the Sacraments by way of ſeal ratifie and confirm unto us. <hi>Abraham</hi> had this righteouſneſſe of Faith revealed to him by promiſe, the Goſpel being preached to him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. He had alſo the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> given in promiſe as a ſpecial gift to his poſteriry; This was now confirm'd alſo to him in his Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion.

Every baptized man hath the righteouſneſſe of Faith in Promiſe, and ratified to him in Baptiſme, and whatſoever elſe is
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:168215:221"/> made over in promiſe by reaſon of any ſpecial calling or relation which is of God, is confirm'd in Baptiſme likewiſe. When we are put of God into any way, we have his promiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.11. to be kept in that way. This promiſe is aſſured and confirmed in Baptiſme, Miniſters are called of God, and commiſſioned for their work, in which we know they have many and large promiſes; all of theſe in their Baptiſme are confirmed to them.</p>

This is clear. Circumciſion was a ſeal of the righteouſneſſe of faith; and in caſe, Sacraments in the dayes of the Goſpel ſeal not this to Chriſtians, we muſt then leave the Apoſtles, and ſeek a new way of happineſſe. Yea, if then there were any Sacrament properly ſo called, (as ſome argue) that Sacrament muſt neceſſarily be of the ſame, and no other uſe and ſignification than theſe, which followed after in the time of the Law, and dayes of the Goſpel, ſeeing thoſe Fathers were under the ſame promiſe of the righteouſneſſe of faith, That was <hi>Noah</hi>'s inheritance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7.

<pb n="425" facs="tcp:168215:223"/> gives the very name of our leading Sacrament unto theirs; they were all baptized unto <hi>Moſes</hi> (ſaith he) in the Cloud &amp; in the Sea. 2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, he declares that the thing ſignified was the ſame in theirs, as it is in our Sacraments. They ate the ſame ſpiritual meat, and they drank the ſame ſpiritual drink, and ſo from hence this Argument is obvious. Where there is the ſame name, and the ſame thing, there is the ſame Ordinance in ſubſtance; But here is the ſame name and the ſame thing (as we have ſeen); and therefore the Ordinances are in ſubſtance the ſame. <hi>The Apoſtle gives no greater excellency</hi> (ſaith <hi>Calvin) to our Sacraments then to theirs, when he ſaith, that the fathers ate the ſame spiritual meat with us, interpreting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that that meat is Chriſt. Bellarmine</hi> here finds ſeverall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties (as he calls them) ſeemingly making for us againſt him, and preſſes them further then he can find ſtrength to anſwer. 1. If the Jewes ate the ſame ſpiritual meat, and drank the ſame ſpiritual drink as we do in the Lords Supper, then there was the ſame vertue in Manna as in the Lords Supper. To this he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, that they all are of the ſame meat one as others among themſelves, but not the ſame with that which we eat. But, I had rather follow the Apoſtles own Comment then <hi>Bellarmines:</hi> and he interprets this meat to be Chriſt: and unleſs we feed not on Chriſt, we and they have the ſame ſpiritual food. For, as the Apoſtle tells us, they fed on him. 2. If it were ſpiritual meat, ſpiritual drink, wherewith they were fed, it had the ſame effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as our Sacraments. Ours have no efficacy above that which is ſpiritual. 3. He ſaith, we urge the ſtate of the queſtion which the Apoſtle there handles. The Apoſtle there warns Chriſtians not to reſt too much in their fruition of Sacraments, ſo as to think themſelves ſafe, becauſe they were baptized and admitted to the Lords Supper, ſeeing Sacraments like to theſe, little availed the fathers that did not abſtain from ſin. And laſtly, <hi>Auſtin</hi> is produced on our behalf, who, Tractate on <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. ſaith, That the Sacraments of the Jewes and ours were different in their ſignes, but the ſame in the thing ſignified.

That which was ſeen in Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, differed much from water in Baptiſme; and a Lamb, whether of the herd or flock, differs much from bread and wine. 2. Ours are of greater eaſe then theirs. There was pain and ſmart in Circumciſion; which the new Circumciſed <hi>Shechemites</hi> felt to their coſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34.25. which happily might occaſion the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of circumciſion of <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſonne, through the Mothers tenderneſſe, as may be gathered from her words, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.25. Neither was the Paſſeover without coſt and pains; eſpecially to them that lived at a great diſtance from <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> 3. There is farre more light accompanying our Sacraments then theirs, not in themſelves; for as much might be gathered, if not more, for ſignificancy from their outward ſigns, then from ours; but by reaſon of the clear diſcovery of the promiſes, and open, full ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of their uſe. 4. Ours were without blood, theirs were accompanied with blood, one of the perſon receiving, the other in the ſign received. 5. Old Teſtament-Sacraments had their period, and others follow in their place: Ours muſt not ceaſe until all time ceaſeth, Baptiſme muſt hold <hi>to the end of the world,</hi> Matth. 28.20. And the Lords Supper <hi>until Chriſt come,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.26. But none of theſe make any ſubſtantial difference, nor any more then that which is circumſtantial, or gradual; The outward dreſſe in which they differently appear, can make no difference in ſubſtance. A ſeal is one and the ſame, whether the wax be red, green, or yellow, yea, whether the impreſſion be in wax, or dough, whether the ſignet have the Letters of a mans name, or the Arms that he gives. Men look at the grant to which the ſeal is put, and not at theſe circumſtances. Neither matters it whether they be done with trouble or eaſe, and where their worth is not known, they are not therefore in themſelves of leſſe value. And though they do not endure alwaies, their efficacy is yet no leſſe, whileſt they laſt. If we eye circumſtances of this nature, ours may be advanced; But if we eye the ſubſtantial work, theirs will be equal. Hereupon ſo different ſpeeches are quoted from <hi>Austins</hi> pen; Some highly advancing our Sacraments above theirs, and others parallelling theirs with ours, which with this diſtinction may be fairly reconciled, and (as we have heard) the author himſelf thus reconciles them.</p>

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the contents affixed to the reſpective Chapters in our laſt tranſlation, ſeem otherwiſe ſingularly exact, ſo that that great Critick, <hi>Ainſworth</hi> (who cannot be ſuſpected to do it out of any humor of imitation) in his tranſlation of the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> and the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> very rarely differs from them, it is wonder how that ſlip came into the contents affixed to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. thus expreſt, 1. <hi>The Sacraments of the Jewes,</hi> 6. <hi>are types of ours,</hi> 7. <hi>and their puniſhments,</hi> 11. <hi>enſamples for us,</hi> when it ſhould rather have been 1. <hi>The Sacraments of the Jewes are the ſame with ours,</hi> 5. <hi>their puniſhments are enſamples for us.</hi> The four firſt verſes making the Sacraments there mentioned to be of the ſame uſe with ours,

                        <p>THen it followes by way of neceſſary Corollary, that Chriſtians ſhould ſee,<note place="margin">All muſt ſee that they be rightly princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled in the doctrine of this righteouſneſſe.</note> that they be rightly principled in this doctrine of the righteouſneſſe of faith, as that in which the great mercy of the new Covenant, and all that the Sacraments ſeal is comprized. Ignorance of this, being the undoing of the zealous Jew, A mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake or flaw here muſt needs be of ſingular danger. And here thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may be ſuppoſed to be moſt of all ſecure, ſeeing there is no imaginable righteouſneſſe, but they hedge it in: as may appear in a brief view of their doctrine. That righteouſneſſe which muſt ſave, either muſt be wrought by our ſelves, and ſo ſtiled our righteouſneſſe; or elſe it muſt be wrought by an other, and made ours. There is no righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a third ſort. That which is wrought by our ſelves, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according to the command of God, preſcribed in the law, or elſe over, above, and beſides the Law, aſſumed by our ſelves, or received by tradition. As Phariſees had an high zeal for both of theſe, whereof <hi>Paul</hi> in his unconverſion is an inſtance, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.14. So it is at leaſt pretended by theſe perſons, though their zeal for their righteouſneſſe of the law, falls farre ſhort of that for the tradition of the Church. And for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, beſides their own, wrought by others, they take in not onely the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt; but alſo the ſuperero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Saints; which, as they perſwade themſelves, is ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, not onely for the Saints themſelves, but for others. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> makes it her care to take in the whole of all theſe branches of righteouſneſſe, and in all of them they place their juſtification. Here we had need of the clew of Scriptures to lead us. That righteouſneſſe which according to the precept
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:168215:226"/> of the Law, is to be wrought by our ſelves; as to ſanctification or qualification of the ſoul in the way of ſalvation; we muſt vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly purſue and not diſclaim. As Chriſt when he was accuſed by the Phariſees to deſtroy the law, and to be an enemy to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe; to take off this calumny, he tells his Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.20. <hi>I ſay unto you, that except your righteouſneſſe, ſhall exceed the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall in no caſe enter into the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi> So we may ſay to theſe adverſaries that charge us to be enemies of good works, except your righteouſneſſe exceed the righteouſneſſe of theſe ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ones, ye can by no means enter into the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. The righteouſneſſe of a Papiſt being of the ſelf ſame ſtamp with that of the Phariſees, for tradition the <hi>Trent</hi> Councel makes known their zeal, Concil. Triden. Seſſ. quart. p. 11. <hi>With the ſame degree of reverence, and eſteem we receive the Traditions of our Fathers, as we do the bookes of the Old and New Teſtament;</hi> and how defective both of them were touching the righteouſneſſe of the law, their agreement in the gloſſe which they put upon the law is a ſufficient witneſſe. The Phariſees gloſſe on the law we may read in Chriſts refutation, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. and the ſeveral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, which Chriſt there delivers, tranſcending the Phariſees dictates, Papiſts will have to be no branches of the law, but Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Counſels added to it; So that B. <hi>Hall</hi> quotes a ſpeech of <hi>Serrarius</hi> the Jeſuite that the Phariſees may not unfitly be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to Catholiques, adding as his own, <hi>that one egge is not liker to an other, then the Tridentine Fathers to theſe Jeſuites.</hi> Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogating righteouſneſſe, and that which is bottom'd on tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we muſt wholly ſhun. It is enough that we can bring it up to the rule, in the parts of it, it muſt not exceed. It is hard to determine whether a man that caſts off all regard of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or a man of ſuch righteouſneſſe, be more hatefull in Gods preſence; one utterly ſleights the ſoveraignty of God, and the other corrects his wiſdome; one refuſes to ſerve at all, the other ſerves onely, according to his own pleaſure. As to the other branch of righteouſneſſe wrought by others, The ſuppoſed ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Saints muſt be left, and the Lord Chriſts alone choſen. That ſpeech of Chriſt in the Prophet <hi>Iſai.</hi> 63.3. ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the conqueſt of his enemies, <hi>I have trod the Wine-preſſe alone, and of the people there were none with me,</hi> holds true, when it is applied (as by many it hath been, though not according to the
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:168215:226"/> letter of the text) to his ſatisfaction, <hi>By one offering he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected for ever thoſe that are ſanctified,</hi> Heb. 10.14. yea, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Chriſt, in the matter of juſtification muſt ſtand alone, in oppoſition to all righteouſneſſe in the world, whether of others, imaginarily to be applyed, out of any publique treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, by way of indulgence; or wrought by our ſelves, either by the ſtrength of natural abilities without grace, (which the Papiſts confeſſe to be too weak) or in grace, and theſe works (how great an honour ſoever of late is put upon them) come ſhort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to juſtification likewiſe, as plainly appears by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles argumentation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. <hi>By the deeds of the Law there ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight,</hi> giving this in for his reaſon, <hi>for by the Law is the knowledg of ſin.</hi> The argument runs thus, Where the Law diſcovers ſin, the works commanded by it cannot juſtifie; This propoſition is the Apoſtles: But the law diſcovers ſinne, even in thoſe in whom grace here hath its moſt perfect work; This needs not to be proved: Therefore works comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the law, and done by aſſiſtance of grace in the regenerate cannot juſtifie. And that the Apoſtle diſclaims all righteouſneſſe any other way his own, then by free imputation from God in the work of juſtification, is clear, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>I know nothing by my ſelf, yet am I not hereby juſtified.</hi> Though he had the witneſſe of a good conſcience, as his rejoycing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. Yet this is not his juſtification, when the Rhemiſts on the place, and <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> de juſtificat. urge this text againſt aſſurance of ſalvation, Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> Treat. of Faith. pag. 107. ſaith, <hi>This text makes ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt juſtification by works, but againſt certainty of ſalvation it makes nothing.</hi> And <hi>Pareus</hi> upon the words ſaith, <hi>Hence it is moſt firmly concluded that by the works of the law no man is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> If ſo great an Apoſtle cannot be juſtified by works, then much leſſe others. His works were certainly done by the power of grace, and upon new-Covenant-engagements. That of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> Aphor. of juſtif. pag. 307. muſt ſtand as an eternal truth; who after that he had laid down the Socinians tenent, that they acknowledg not that Chriſt hath ſatisfied the Law for us, and conſequently is none of our legal righteouſneſſe, but onely hath ſet us a coppy to write after, and is become our pattern, and that we are juſtified by following him, as a captain and guide to heaven and ſo all our proper righteouſneſſe is in this obedience; And having mark'd it with this juſt brand, <hi>[Moſt curſed doctrine]</hi> he
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:168215:227"/> addes, <hi>So far am I from this, that I ſay, The righteouſneſſe which we muſt plead againſt the lawes accuſations, is not one grain of it in our faith or works, but all out of us in Chriſts ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As this righteouſneſſe which is no otherwiſe ours, but by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation (being neither inherent in us,<note place="margin">Faith the alone grace that intereſts us in this righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> nor wrought by us) muſt ſtand entire, and ſole in our juſtification: ſo faith muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be the alone grace which intereſts us in it, and attains to our reconciliation to God in Chriſt, otherwiſe why is it that not onely the denomination is ſtill from faith onely? (as we ſee in the text, and alwaies when it is named, it is called the righteouſneſſe of faith, and not of hope, love, obedience, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance) But that juſtification is evermore in Scripture aſcribed to this grace? The Apoſtle ſpeaking of Chriſt who is confeſſed to be our righteouſneſſe, ſaith, Whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood. In him, God, who otherwiſe through wrath ſtands at the greateſt diſtance, is propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and this through Faith; on which <hi>Diodate</hi> hath theſe words, <hi>All this hath been done by vertue of Gods appointment, who of his meer will, and full power, hath from everlaſting appointed Chriſt to be the onely means of expiation and reconciliation, applyable to man by faith, which is the means, or inſtrument whereby we receive the mercy of God.</hi> So alſo, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. is very full, <hi>Knowing that a man is not juſtified by the works of the Law, but by faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> The Apoſtle there firſt in the negative ſhewes, where our juſtification is not, and in the next place tells us, in the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive where it is; ſo that all works of all kinds, are by him exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and faith onely is acknowledged. Whereas one ſaith, that <hi>Paul doth either in expreſſe words, or in the ſenſe and ſcope of his speech, exclude onely the works of the Law, that is, the fulfilling of the condition of the Law our ſelves, but never the fulfilling of the Gospel-conditions,</hi> that we may have part in Chriſt; It is fully againſt the Apoſtle, if by fulfilling the Goſpel-condition any thing but faith be underſtood. All works are excluded, and faith as in oppoſition to works is acknowledged, and we have our part or intereſt in Chriſt, in or by fulfilling of no other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-condition, then that of faith, whereby we receive Chriſt, and Chriſt dwells in us, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. The ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour teaches us to <hi>diſtinguiſh betwixt our firſt poſſeſſion of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication (which is upon our contract with Chriſt, or meer faith) and
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:168215:227"/> the confirmation, continuation and accompliſhment of it, whoſe condition is alſo ſincere obedience and perſeverance.</hi> But being firſt poſſeſt of juſtification, we are juſtified, and of this <hi>Paul</hi> ſtill ſpeaks, and there is no interciſion of it, nor any other way in progreſſe of time to be intereſted in it. Being juſtified we enter upon are reconciled ſtate, which is never loſt, and held up onely by Chriſt upon the intereſt of our faith. Obedience and Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance are both of neceſſity to obtain the end of our Faith, the ſalvation of our ſoules, but not to give us this intereſt in Chriſt. Sin in the elect-regenerate, may work a man (as hath been ſaid) under preſent wrath, but renders him not a child of wrath; brings upon him an inaptitude for glory, but makes him not ſimply liable to condemnation for eternity. This accompliſhment of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſenſe ſpoken to, is no other then glorification; and theſe two are diſtinct links in <hi>Paul</hi>'s golden chain (as it is called) <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Whom he did predeſtinate, them alſo he called; and whom he called, them alſo he juſtified; and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified.</hi> As Predeſtination differs from vocation, and juſtification; ſo Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo from glorification; when our firſt poſſeſſion of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is acknowledged to be of meer faith, <hi>Paul's</hi> juſtification is confeſſed to be of meer faith likewiſe. The ſame Authour ſaith, <hi>Paul doth by the word [faith] especially direct your thoughts to Chriſt believed in: for to be juſtified by Chriſt, and to be juſtified by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Chriſt is with him all one;</hi> and I am ſure faith alone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives Chriſt, and no Evangelical work either of obedience or perſeverance; therefore Faith alone juſtifies. There is added, <hi>And when he doth mention faith, as the condition, he alwayes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth obedience to Chriſt, therefore [believing] and [obeying the Goſpel] are put for the two ſummaries of the whole conditions:</hi> But Faith as an inſtrument receiving Chriſt is the condition, when the Evangeliſt complains, that <hi>He came to his own, and his own received him not,</hi> Joh. 1.11. he points out their neglect of the condition required: They were his in Covenant, or elſe they had not been called his own; and in not receiving him they fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the condition required of them; and in the words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Evangeliſt ſpeaks of thoſe of his own in Covenant, that did make good the condition of it, and that is no otherwiſe then by believing; <hi>But as many as received him, to them he gave power to be the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name.</hi> And this faith implyes onely acceptation, though it be an act of the
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:168215:228"/> ſoul that yeelds obedience. It is further ſaid, <hi>Our full juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and our everlaſting ſalvation have the ſame conditions on our part: But ſincere Obedience is without all doubt a condition of our ſalvation; Therefore alſo of our juſtification.</hi> Here is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a manifeſt tautology, or an errour. For either full juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and ſalvation are both one, and ſo here is a tautology; or elſe, if they differ, it is an errour. The ſame are not condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of both ſtrictly taken, onely Faith gives title to Chriſt for Juſtification; Works qualifie as a condition in order to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. And whereas it is further ſaid, <hi>It would be as derogatory to Chriſts righteouſneſſe if we be ſaved by works, as if we be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by them.</hi> Either of both is doubtleſſe derogatory to it, and therefore ſtill diſclaimed in Scriptures, and alwayes expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, except in that one Text of <hi>James,</hi> Jam. 2. which ſpeakes to Juſtification, and muſt admit of another interpretation then our Authour would put upon it, otherwiſe he can neither be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to himſelf, nor to the whole current of the Goſpel. Works may be <hi>cauſa ſine quâ non</hi> of ſalvation, or a qualification of thoſe that are ſaved, as, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. <hi>He became the Authour of eternal ſalvation to all them that obey him.</hi> But this is not to be ſaved by works, which the Apoſtle denyes, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.9. Not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt. And works of this efficiency, wrought through grace, will raiſe a man to boaſtings, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the Phariſees <hi>[God, I thank thee.]</hi> But ſeeing there are ſeveral new queſtions ſtarted, <hi>Whether Faith be an inſtrument in Juſtification? Whether works do not juſtifie? Whether the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant have any condition? Whether Faith be not the alone condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? And how Repentance can be a condition of the Covenant, and not of Juſtification?</hi> And Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> is almoſt on every hand ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to, I ſuppoſe it will not be ungrateful to the Reader, if in this place I commend to him the words of that Reverend Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, (though it be in a larger way, then quotations are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily brought) in which we have not barely his authority, (which I do not offer to put in the balance with any) but the Points in queſtion with ſingular ſtrength, debated and ſpoken to; Treating of the Covenant of Grace, pag. 18. he ſaith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is called for in this Covenant, as it ſetteth forth the ſubject capable of ſalvation by faith,<note place="margin">Luke 13.5. Acts 11.18. 2 Cor. 7.10. Ezek. 18.27.</note> but is it ſelf onely an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of ſin no healing of our wound, or cauſe of our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance. The feeling of pain and ſickneſſe, cauſeth a man to
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:168215:228"/> deſire and ſeek remedy, but it is no remedy it ſelf. Hunger and thirſt make a man deſire and ſeek for food, but a man is not fed by being hungry. By repentance we know our ſelves, we feel our ſickneſſe, we hunger and thirſt after grace, but the hand which we ſtretch forth to receive it, is faith alone, without which repentance is nothing but darkneſſe and deſpair. Repentance is the condition of faith, and the qualification of a perſon capable of ſalvation, on our part required. It is a penitent and peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning Faith, whereby we receive the Promiſes of mercy, but we are not juſtified partly by prayer, partly by Repentance, and partly by Faith, but that faith which ſtirreth up godly ſorrow for ſin, and enforceth us to pray for pardon and ſalvation. Faith is a neceſſary and lively inſtrument of Juſtification, which is amongſt the number of true cauſes, not being a cauſe without which the thing is not done; but a cauſe whereby it is done. The cauſe without which a thing is not done, is onely preſent in the action, and doth nothing therein: but as the eye is an active inſtrument for ſeeing, and the eare for hearing; ſo is faith alſo for juſtifying. If it be demanded, whoſe inſtrument it is? It is the inſtrument of the ſoul, wrought therein by the Holy Ghoſt, and is the free gift of God. In the Covenant of works, works were required as the cauſe of life and happineſſe: but in the Covenant of grace, though repentance be neceſſary, and muſt accompany faith, yet not repentance but faith onely is the cauſe of life. The cauſe not efficient, as works ſhould have been, if man had ſtood in the former Covenant, but inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall onely: for it is impoſſible that Chriſt, the death and blood of Chriſt, and our faith, ſhould be together the efficient or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing cauſes of Juſtification or ſalvation.<note place="margin">Rom. 3.21, 22, 28, 30. Gal. 2.16, 17. Rom. 4.2, 3.</note> When the Apoſtle writeth, that man is not juſtified by works, or through works, by the Law, or through the Law (oppoſing Faith and Works in the matter of Juſtification, but not in reſpect of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; Faith, I ſay, and works, not faith and merits which could never be) without doubt he excludes the efficiency and force of the Law and works in juſtifying: But the particles [By] and [Of] do not in the ſame ſenſe, take Juſtification from the Law and Works, in which they give it to faith. For faith onely doth behold and receive the promiſes of life and mercy; but the Law, and Works, reſpect the Commandments, not the Promiſes of meer grace. When therefore Juſtification and life is ſaid to be
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:168215:229"/> by Faith, it is manifeſtly ſignified, that faith receiving the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,<note place="margin">Deut. 7.12. &amp; 10.12. Jer. 7.23. Lev. 19.17, 18. Luk. 10.27. Mark 12.30.</note> doth receive righteouſneſſe and life freely promiſed. Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to all Gods Commandments is covenanted, not as the cauſe of life, but as the qualification and effect of faith, and as the way to life. Faith that imbraceth life is obediential, and fruitful in all good works: but in one ſort faith is the cauſe of obedience and good works, and in another of Juſtification and life eternal. Theſe it ſeeketh in the promiſes of the Covenant: thoſe it worketh and produceth, as the cauſe doth the effect. Faith was the efficient cauſe of that precious oblation in <hi>Abel,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Heb. 11.4, 7, &amp;c.</note> of reverence and preparing the Ark in <hi>Noah,</hi> of obedience in <hi>Abraham;</hi> but it was the inſtrument onely of their Juſtification. For it doth not juſtifie as it produceth good works, but as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth Chriſt; though it cannot receive Chriſt, unleſſe it bring forth good works. A diſpoſition to good works is neceſſary to Juſtification, being the qualification of an active and lively faith. Good works of all ſorts are neceſſary to our continuance in the ſtate of Juſtification, and ſo to our final abſolution, if God give opportunity: but they are not the cauſe of, but onely a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent qualification or condition to final forgiveneſſe and eternal bliſſe. If then when we ſpeak of the conditions of the Covenant of grace, by condition we underſtand whatſoever is required on our part, as precedent, concomitant, or ſubſequent to Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, repentance, faith and obedience are all conditions: but if by condition we underſtand what is required on our part, as the cauſe of the good promiſed, though onely inſtrumental, faith or belief in the promiſes of free mercy is the onely condition. Faith and works are oppoſed in the matter of Juſtification and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Covenant; not that they cannot ſtand together in the ſame ſubject, for they be inſeparably united, but becauſe they cannot concur or meet together in one and the ſame Court to the Juſtification or abſolution of man. For in the Court of Juſtice according to the firſt Covenant, either being juſt, he is acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; or unjuſt, he is condemned: But in the Court of mercy, if thou receive the promiſe of pardon, which is done by a lively faith, thou art acquitted and ſet free, and accepted as juſt and righteous: but if thou believe not, thou art ſent over to the Court of Juſtice. Thus far Mr. <hi>Ball.</hi> In which words of his the blood of Chriſt, faith in his blood, repentance and works have all of them their due place aſſigned them. The blood of
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:168215:229"/> Chriſt as the alone efficient procuring cauſe, Faith as the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment giving intereſt, and making application: Repentance as a neceſſary qualification of the juſtified perſon in order to glory. In this (which is the good old Proteſtant doctrine) God loſeth nothing of his grace, but all is free in the work. Chriſt loſeth nothing of his merit, it ſtands alone as the procuring cauſe. Faith receives all from Chriſt, but takes nothing off from the free grace of God, or Chriſts merits. God loſeth nothing of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty, and man is not at all diſpenſed with in his duty. God is advanced in his goodneſſe and Soveraignty: man is kept hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, thankful, and in ſubjection, no place being left for his pride, or gap open for licentiouſneſſe.</p>

                           <p>HEre I cannot paſſe by that which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverted on ſome paſſages of mine, in the Treatiſe of the Covenant, concerning the Inſtrumentality of Faith. After I had ſpoke to our Juſtification by Faith, in oppoſition to Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by works, in ſeveral Propoſitions, (of which he is not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to take any notice) I infer, pag. 80. [Theſe things conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red I am truly ſorry, that Faith ſhould be denyed to have the office or place of an inſtrument, in our Juſtification: nay, ſcarce allowed to be called an inſtrument of our receiving Chriſt, that juſtifies us. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> not acquainting his Reader at all, with the premiſes, immediately falls upon this inference: making himſelf ſomewhat merry, with my profeſſing my ſelf to be truly ſorry for this thing; telling me <hi>I was as ſorry, that men called, and ſo called, faith the inſtrument of juſtification, as you are that I deny it,</hi> acquainting his Reader with his Reaſons, which he would have to be compared with mine, which he paſſes over in ſilence. 1. <hi>No Scripture doth</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>either in the letter, or ſenſe, call faith an inſtrument of Juſtification.</hi> This the Reader muſt take on his word, and it ſhould further be conſidered, whether he do not in the ſame page contradict himſelf, where he ſaith, <hi>It is onely the unfitneſſe, or impropriety of the phraſe that he mentions, and not the ſenſe.</hi> 2. Saith he, <hi>I knew I had much Scripture, and
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:168215:230"/> reaſon againſt it;</hi> but I find no reaſon from him, but that which ſome know that I have urged <hi>Terminis Terminantibus,</hi> before his Aphoriſmes ever came to light; and had I not been able to have given my ſelf ſatisfaction, I had been in that opinion (if not before him, yet) before I had any light from him, to lead me to it. That horned Argument of his, that if faith juſtifie as inſtrument, it is either as an inſtrument in the hand of God, or in the hand of man, with his reaſons againſt both, I have made uſe of <hi>argumentandi cauſâ,</hi> before any work of his ſaw the light. 3.<note place="margin">The inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality of faith makes not man the efficient cauſe of his own Juſtification.</note> 
                              <hi>I thought it</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of dangerous conſequence to ſay, that man is the efficient cauſe of juſtifying, and pardoning himſelf, and ſo doth forgive his own ſins.</hi> And I think every honeſt man ſhould be of that mind, and I ſhall wait the time when proof ſhall be made, that Juſtification by faith, in oppoſition to works, makes man <gap reason="foreign">

If this be once made good, I ſhall be more ſorry than ever for holding ſuch ſelf-exalting and man-advancing doctrine as Juſtification by faith, and that ever I op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that ſelf-denying, man-depreſſing doctrine of Juſtification by works, and ſhall hence forth conclude, <hi>Where is boaſting then? It is excluded: by what Law? of faith? Nay, but by the Law of works.</hi> There is added, <hi>Yet all this had never cauſed me to open my mouth againſt it, but for the next, viz. I found that many learned Divines did not onely aſſert this inſtrumentality, but laid ſo great a ſtreſſe upon it, as if the main difference betwixt us and the Papiſts lay here. For in the doctrine of Juſtification it is, ſay they, that they fundamentally erre, and we principally differ, and that in theſe four Points.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Four great errours laid to the charge of Reformers.</note> 1. <hi>About the formal cauſe of our righteouſneſſe, which, ſay theſe Divines, is the formal righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt, as ſuffering and perfectly obeying for us; or, as others adde, in the habitual righteouſneſſe of his humane nature; and others, the natural righteouſneſſe of the Divine nature.</hi> 2. <hi>About the way and manner of our participation therein, which as to Gods act, they ſay is imputation, (which is true) and that in this ſenſe that</hi> legaliter <hi>we are eſteemed to have fulfilled the Law in Chriſt.</hi> 3. <hi>About the nature of that faith which juſtifies; which, moſt of our forreign Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers ſay, is an aſſurance, or full perſwaſion of the pardon of my ſin by Chriſts blood.</hi> 4. <hi>About the formal reaſon of faiths intereſt in Juſtification, which, ſay they, is as the inſtrument thereof.</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his own cenſure, <hi>I doubt not but all theſe four are great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</hi>
                              <pb n="439" facs="tcp:168215:230"/> Of how dangerous conſequence ſoever it is, that man ſhould be made the efficient of juſtifying, and pardoning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, yet it had paſs'd without controll, if worſe than this had not been vented, by the learned of the reformed Religion; It is yet well, that when the ignorance of all his profeſſed Antagoniſts is of that eminence, that yet ſo many learned are on their party. Thoſe learned errours ſhould be taken into further conſideration, and ſome that are learned, have entred the liſts with Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in them. The ſecond of theſe great errours he tells us is true, and how a great errour can be true, I cannot tell, unleſſe his meaning be, that it is truly an errour, which is as high an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal ſpeech as any that is faſtened upon the Scriptures. And when this ſecond is true; I cannot ſee, (and I think few of his Readers will ſee) how the firſt to which it relates can be falſe. If it be true, that by Gods imputation of this righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, we are <hi>legalitèr</hi> eſteemed to have fulfilled the Law in Chriſt, then that is true alſo, that they ſay, that Chriſt is our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, or that the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt of meer grace is made ours. And how much good will is here ſhewen to the <hi>reforming</hi> part is too manifeſt, in making one Party amongſt them to hold,<note place="margin">The natural righteouſneſſe of Chriſts Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature is not our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</note> 
                              <hi>that the natural righteouſneſſe of the Divine nature is our Juſtification,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> did before him, and is anſwered by <hi>Davenant,</hi> de juſt. habit. p. 313. <hi>That in this all the Churches of the Proteſtants have exploded Hoſiander;</hi> It being his ſingular opinion; and another ſayes, <hi>This opinion was almoſt like Jonas his gourd that did preſently wither.</hi> As for the third, the charge is upon our forreign <hi>Reformers</hi> onely; and not upon all that have idly buſied their learned heads in this bad cauſe; They one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, that ſaith is a full perſwaſion of the pardon of my ſins by Chriſts blood. I ſhall requeſt from him therefore a Latine Treatiſe; for their better information in this thing, and not to trouble Controverſies in Engliſh, with that, in which his Engliſh Antagoniſts ſtand right, himſelf being witneſſe. Neither is it all forreign Divine that go that way; <hi>Gomarus</hi> putting it to the queſtion ſaith, That there be ſome of thoſe that have oppoſed Papiſts on either part,<note place="margin">All forreign Reformers make no faith a full perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> and himſelf determines with them that ſide in this with our Engliſh Reformers, Tom. 2. pag. 371. So that in theſe three our Engliſh Reformers at leaſt ſtand fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted. That which followes, I doubt not will be the trouble of many of his Readers. <hi>That which troubled me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:168215:231"/> this, to think how many thouſand might be confirmed in Popery by this courſe, and what a blow it gave to the reformed Religion. For who can imagine but that young Popiſh ſtudents will be confirmed in the reſt of their religion, when they find that we erre in theſe, and will judge by theſe of the reſt of our doctrine; eſpecially when they find us making this the main part of the Proteſtant cauſe, what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if they judg our cauſe naught?</hi> It is a greater wonder, that old Popiſh ſtudents have not diſcovered this to their novices, but have left this work to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> to give them light in this in which <hi>Reformers</hi> ſo erre, and unreformed Papiſts ſtand right, ſo that it muſt be his work, not <hi>Bellarmines, Stapletons, Suarez</hi> or any others to unreform.</p>
                           <p>But leſt this ſhould be a ſtumbling block to offence, that ſo eminent a man (that is like, if himſelf may be heard, to draw away ſo many) ſpeaks out ſuch Language; let us oppoſe againſt him on the other hand, <hi>Albertus Pighius,</hi> whom <hi>thoſe of his party</hi> (as <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> ſaies, loc. com. pag. 541. <hi>made their Achilles, and thought, that he alone by his ſubtile wit, had pierced into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Myſteries of truth.</hi> So that I hope I am not too low in my compariſon.<note place="margin">

Laſtly, He gives his reaſon, why the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is imputed to us for juſtification.</hi> And then addes, <hi>Many more things are found in the ſame author, who, though in other controverſies, he maintains a fierce warre with Proteſtants, yet being overcome with the clear light of truth in this of Juſtification, he fell off from the Papiſts and came over to our party.</hi> And <hi>Capel</hi> in his preface to Mr. <hi>Pembles</hi> tract of juſtification, <hi>Pighius</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>though of a peeviſh ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit enough, yet reading</hi> Calvin, <hi>to confute Calvin, in the very doctrine of juſtification, was confuted himſelf, and wrote with us)</hi> but alſo acknowledged by our adverſaries. <hi>Albertus Pighius is checkt by Bellarmine</hi> (ſaith Dr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> lect. 5. Pag. 165.) <hi>for that in reading our authors, himſelf at laſt became a Lutheran, in this arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</hi> And that <hi>Pighius</hi> may not ſtand alone on our parts among
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:168215:231"/> Romaniſts; <hi>Davenant</hi> in the place quoted produces many others. 1. <hi>The whole covent of Canons at Cullen</hi> in their book which they entituled <hi>Antididagma,</hi> Who acknowledge the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted righteouſneſſe of Chriſt to be the chief cauſe of our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Titu. de juſtific. 2. <hi>The Romiſh party in the Conference of Ratisbone,</hi> Who (ſaith he) gave their vote the ſame way, pag. 47. 3. <hi>Iſidore Clacius,</hi> orat. 40. in Luc. 4. <hi>Naclantus Epiſcopus Clodienſis,</hi> cap. 1. ad Epheſ. pag. 59, 72.

And Dr. <hi>Prideaux,</hi> ſaith, that <hi>almoſt four yeares before the Councel of Trent he had ſo aſſerted the orthodox doctrine of Juſtification, that (being, as is thought, taken away by poyſon) he did not long ſurvive.</hi> And for the whole ſpace between <hi>Gregory</hi> and the reformation, our author pronounces it, that authors generally for the moſt part were more ſound in their commentaries, then in their diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in their meditations, ſoliloquies, and conflict of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; then in their polemicks.

So that in caſe they have one of eminence amongſt us, we have one of theirs as eminent: and in caſe he ſhould prove too light, we have many more into the bargain to make up weight.</p>
                           <p>There followes, <hi>Now to the thing it ſelf: Your Arguments for faiths inſtrumentality to Juſtification I will conſider, when I can find them.</hi> And his Reader will conſider no more of his jeeres, when he can look into his books, and his eyes miffe of them. Some of thoſe of whom he hath made boaſt, as his converts in this controverſy, have profeſſed themſelves ſatisfied with that which I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, though Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> cannot find it. I am told that <hi>I begin and ſay more for faiths Inſtrumentality in receiving Chriſt, than for the inſtrumentality of it in Juſtification.</hi> And the truth is, I know not how to diſtinguiſh them. If it be an inſtrument to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt, that doth juſtifie; it is with me an inſtrument in Juſtification. If mine eye be an inſtrument by which I receive in light, for ſight; then mine eye is the organ, or inſtrument of ſight. If I prove the one, I think I cannot be denyed the other. The Inſtrumentality of faith for receiving Chriſt, is thus reaſoned
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:168215:232"/> againſt. <hi>If Faith be the inſtrument of receiving Chriſt then it is either the act, or the habit of Faith, that is the Inſtrument.</hi> I am well aware that if I ſhall affirm either of theſe, that then either ſome text of Scripture will be called for ſpecifying ſuch habit or act of faith in juſtification, or a needleſſe ſtirre will be made about theſe Logical notions. The ſafeſt way then is to ſay with Scripture, that faith is the grace that receives Chriſt, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts us in propitiation in his blood, and the grace by which upon that account we are juſtified, without limitation of it to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the act or habit. Neither can any anſwer, (as I ſuppoſe) be thus given, but ſuch as will <hi>coincidere;</hi> If I ſay the habit juſtifies, it is as it puts forth it ſelf into act;<note place="margin">Whether the act of faith, or the habit doth juſtifie?</note> If I ſay the act juſtifies, it muſt be as it comes from the habit, and ſo both habit and act juſtifie. Neither doth a mans juſtification ceaſe when the habit of Faith in ſleep ceaſeth acting, ſeeing juſtification denotes a ſtate which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, and abiding. It is further ſaid, <hi>Receiving ſtrictly taken is ever paſſive.</hi> A reaſon then may be ſeen, why Divines have called faith a paſſive inſtrument in juſtification; and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> may ſee a fair anſwer to the high, and indeed ſcornful cenſure, that he gives to the moſt learned, (as himſelf ſtiles them) in his preface to this apology. <hi>The moſt learned</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the upſhot flie to this that</hi> credere, <hi>is not</hi> agere, <hi>but</hi> pati, <hi>and is but</hi> Actio Grammatica, <hi>or the name of action, but Phyſically or Hyperphyſically a ſuffering: Is not here a curious doctrine of faith, and Juſtification? If Ariſtotle had been a Chriſtian, he could not have comprehended it.</hi> But I confeſſe I ſee no reaſon to make receiving,<note place="margin">Neither recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving are in the Authors thoughts meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſive.</note> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believing, to be at leaſt meerly paſſive. There is alwaies an act of the will, in rational agents in receiving, properly ſo called, and often of the hand. The receivers of cuſtome are agents for the States, and in their receipt are active. <hi>Receiving in a civil, ethical, leſſe proper ſenſe</hi> (as is further ſaid) <hi>is but the act of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting what is offered.</hi> But is not this accepting properly receiving? or is not receiving properly ſo called, at leaſt neceſſarily joyned with it, in ſuch civil ethical reception? When I give a beggar an almes, does not he in as ſtrict a ſenſe receive it, as I do give it? and this is either his act of acceptance, or that which accompanies it. If I put water into a veſſel, the veſſel rather contains it, then receives it. If I give a child a laſh, he rather ſuffers then receives <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>t. So that receiving ſtrictly taken, is as well active as paſſive, and rather active then paſſive. There is added, <hi>When it is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:168215:232"/> a relation, or a</hi> jus ad rem <hi>that is offered, conſent or acceptance, is an act ſo neceſſary ordinarily to the poſſeſſion, or proper paſſive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, that it is therefore called receiving it ſelf;</hi> and it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as I think) called ſo, becauſe it is ſo, and that it hath its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, and way of efficacy for poſſeſſion, I think few except Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will deny. It followes, <hi>Yet ſtill I ſay, if any will pleaſe to call it an inſtrument, in this ſenſe, I will not quarrel with him for the impropriety of a phraſe, eſpecially if ſome men had the ſame ingenuity that others have, that ſay it is but Inſtrumentum Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoricum.</hi> There is not I hope ſo much ingenuity deſired, as to ſmother or blind their reaſon. If it be a metaphorical inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there muſt be ſome real analogy between it and an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment properly ſo called, in doing that which is done by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, and when an inſtrument is (as is affirmed) an efficient; An inſtrument without any efficiency at all, is a ſtrange kind of Metaphor; It had been better to have held to the old dialect of <hi>Equivocal.</hi> There followes. <hi>But to ſay</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the act of Faith is the inſtrument of Ethical, active reception, (which is that which I argued againſt) is to ſay receiving Chriſt is the inſtrument of it ſelf.</hi> It will ſure rather follow that Faith is the inſtrument of the ſoul in receiving Chriſt.</p>
                           <p>We ſay faith receives, as we ſay the hand takes,<note place="margin">Faith is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of the ſoul; and not of it ſelf in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Chriſt. That faith is the eye and hand of the ſoul, are Scripture Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors.</note> or the ſword kills; but we mean the man receives by the hand, and the hand kills by the ſword, and ſo we mean the ſoul receives Chriſt by faith. I explained my ſelf in giving inſtance in mens uſual lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage concerning faith, which is rejected with no little diſdain, affirming that theſe ſpeeches. <hi>Faith is the eye of the ſoul, the hand of the ſoul, are Metaphors of meere humane uſe;</hi> forgetting (it ſeems) that ever the Scripture ſaid, that <hi>Moſes by faith endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as ſeeing him that is inviſible;</hi> or that <hi>the promiſe of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is received by faith.</hi> If I had added that faith is the foot of the ſoul, they had all been Metaphors of Divine uſe: I urge Scripture texts. <hi>We receive remiſſion of ſins by faith, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance amongſt them that are ſanctified,</hi> is received by faith, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. To which is replyed. <hi>If [by] ſignifie an inſtrumental cauſe, it is either alwayes, or ſometimes. You would not ſure have your Reader believe that it is alwayes: if but ſometimes, why do you take it for granted that ſo it ſignifies here?</hi> This I might well retort, If it ſignifie and an inſtumental cauſe ſometimes, why is it not made appear, that it does not ſo ſignifie here? But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:168215:233"/> that <hi>[by]</hi> hath not alwayes ſuch ſignification. <hi>Bartimeus</hi> ſate <hi>by</hi> the high-way-ſide begging, in which place <hi>[by]</hi> is no inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but when the particle <hi>[by]</hi> hath reference to that which hath immediate reference to a principal cauſe; and ſometimes is put to the principal cauſe it ſelf: I ſuppoſe nothing elſe but an inſtrument can be intended: when Chriſt is ſaid to be ſet forth a propitiation through faith in his blood, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. and that we are juſtified by his blood, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. I know not how the blood of Chriſt can be a principal cauſe and faith not denote an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I ſaid, why elſe is this righteouſneſſe ſometimes called the <hi>righteouſneſſe of faith,</hi> ſometimes the <hi>righteouſneſſe of God by faith,</hi> but that it is a righteouſneſſe which faith receives? To this is replyed, <hi>It is properer to ſay</hi> Credens recipit credendo, <hi>the believer by believing receives it, then to ſay, faith, eſpecially the act, receives it.</hi> Here is an egregious ſubtilety; It is more proper to ſay, I receieve a gift by my hand, then to ſay, my hand receives it, of the ſame ſtamp with another; where it is ſaid that Scripture ſayes, That we are <hi>juſtified by faith,</hi> yet denyed, that Scripture ſayes, that <hi>faith juſtifies.</hi> But be it ſo, that is properer; does not Scripture ſpeak as improperly? <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, Eare hath not heard.</hi> It had been as much properer to have ſaid, No man hath ſeen with his eye, or heard with his ear. I quote <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Chriſt dwells in us by faith;</hi> and, Gal. 3.14. <hi>We receive the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Spirit through faith.</hi> There I ſay [Scripture ſpeaks of faith as the ſouls inſtrument, to receive Chriſt Jeſus, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Spirit from Chriſt Jeſus:] and I am anſwered. <hi>You odly change the queſtion: we are ſpeaking of faiths inſtrumentality in receiving a right to Chriſt, or Chriſt in relation, and you go about to prove the reception of his Spirit, or graces really, or himſelf objectively,</hi> and ſo we have a large diſcourſe of Chriſts dwelling in us. But is it not to the purpoſe, to ſhew that the phraſe [by faith] notes inſtrumentality which theſe texts make good; and does not Chriſt dwell in us to more purpoſes then one? Is it not to all purpoſes, that by faith we receive him? And then our receiving right to him is not here excluded. I ſaid [the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentality of it in the work of juſtification is denyed, becauſe the nature of an inſtrument as conſidered in Phyſical operations, doth not exactly belong to it; which if it muſt be alwayes rigid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed, will often put us to a ſtand in the aſſignation of cauſes of any kind in moral actions.] To this is replyed, <hi>I ſaid</hi>

Through their great condeſcenſion, I have received animadverſions from many of the moſt learned judicious Divines that I know in</hi> England. <hi>And of all theſe there is but one man that doth own the doctrine of faiths inſtrumentality; but they diſclaime it all, ſome with diſtaste, others with a modeſt excuſe of them that uſe it, and the gentle Interpretation of a metaphorical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, and that remote; for ſo they would have me Interpret our Divines. I told you this when I ſaw you, and you asked me whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mr. C. were againſt it? To which I anſwer, not ſo much as diverſe others, that write to me, but judge you by his own words,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:168215:234"/> which are theſe, [Object. But though faith be not the inſtrument of our juſtification, may it not be called the inſtrument of receiving Chriſt? Anſw. I think they mean ſo and no more who call faith the inſtrument of our juſtification,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I ſhall not be unwilling to yeeld to you, that to ſpeak exactly, faith may better be called a condition of our juſtification] ſo farre Mr.</hi> C. To this I anſwer, 1. Why have we not the authority of Divines that are open to all mens eyes, rather then of thoſe that lye dormant in his hands? and there are ſure more in the preſſe, then in his private ſtudy in Manuſcripts. No one is produced, and I ſcarce think can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. 2. I would he would publiſh to the world the labours of theſe eminently learned perſons; that we, as well as he, might ſee their weak oppoſition of plain Scripture, which ſomewhere is his free cenſure. 3. There are thoſe (if intelligence do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me) that he hath ſaid, he hath brought to his judgement in this thing, that yet have profeſſed themſelves ſatisfied with that which I have ſaid, and are they of both our minds? 4. For Mr. <hi>C.</hi> upon the coming forth of this <hi>Apology</hi> he wrote to me, among other things in theſe words.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>C.</hi> vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> 
                              <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter, pag. 19. <hi>citeth ſome words of mine about faiths inſtrumentality, but it had been fair to have ſignified what I ſay further about it, eſpecially in my ſecond writing, when I perceived what advantage he did take of that which I had ſaid before; onely to avoid contending about words, which I do not like:</hi> ſo far Mr. <hi>C.</hi> I ſaid in my Treatiſe, [the work about which faith is imployed, is not an abſolute, but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative work; a work of God towards man, not without the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all concurrence of man: ſuch in which neither God, nor man are ſole efficients; nor any act of God, or man, can be ſole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, but there muſt be a mutual concurrence of both.] To this is replyed, <hi>A dangerous doctrine in my judgement, to be ſo nakedly affirmed; no doubt but juſtification is a relative change, and it is paſt controverſie, that it is not without the actual concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of man, for he muſt perform the condition on which God will juſtifie him: But that God is not the ſole efficient, nor any act of God the ſole inſtrument, I durſt not have affirmed without proof;</hi> Neither durſt I have charged any mans ſpeech with danger of that nature without diſproof, unleſſe I ſhould think it enough to make it ſo, becauſe in my judgement it appears ſo; and that which is here granted as without controverſie, is with me a proof ſufficient. If it be not done without the actual concurrence of man,
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:168215:234"/> and is done by ſuch concurrence of which we have as many proofs, as there is mention of juſtification by faith, there muſt be ſome kind of efficiency in this concurrence;<note place="margin">There is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in mans concurrence by faith in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I bring for proof the abſurdity that will follow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on denyal in theſe words; [This muſt needs be granted, unleſſe we will bring in Dr. <hi>Criſpes</hi> paſſive recipiency of Chriſt; Chriſts abode in man, without man, in ſpight of man, and ſuppoſe him to be juſtified in unbelief.] To this is replyed. <hi>This is very naked aſſerting; why did you not ſhew ſome reaſon of this ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence?] It's paſt any reach to ſee the leaſt:</hi> If I were too ſhort, it is now done to my hands, where a mutual concurrence of God and man in the work is confeſt; tell me how it can be denyed, unleſſe Chriſt come into man without man, and in ſpite of him; for if man act in it, he muſt needs be an agent. It followes, <hi>Why do you ſtill confound Chriſts real abode in us by his Spirit with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation we have upon juſtification? when even now you affirmed it was a relative work (as you call it) I pray by the next ſhew us more clearly, how theſe abſurdities follow that doctrine.</hi> And doth not a relative work of this nature neceſſarily preſuppoſe this abode by the Spirit? and is not a relative change a neceſſary conſequent of it? If ſtrangers to Chriſt be juſtified by Chriſt,<note place="margin">The relative change in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſes a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</note> I am to learn in the doctrine of juſtification, that deſire of his I think is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſatisfied. I further ſay, faith is diſabled from this office in juſtification, by this argument: If faith be an inſtrument [It is the inſtrument of God or man, &amp;c. to which in my Treatiſe I anſwered, it is the inſtrument of man; though man do not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie himſelf, yet he concurres as a ready willing agent with God in it.] To which is replyed, <hi>If this be not a palpable contradiction, ſaying, and unſaying, my Logick is leſſe then I thought it had been. If it be [mans inſtrument] of juſtification, and yet [man do not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie himſelf] then either man is not man, or an Inſtrument is not an inſtrument, or juſtifying is not juſtifying.</hi> It ſeems he would have us by the way know that his thoughts of his own Logick are not low;<note place="margin">The Author acquit from the charge of a palpable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</note> but if other mens Logick cannot ſolve this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction; yet me thinks his might, who ſayes receiving ſtrictly taken is ever paſſive, and a man may be paſſive in juſtification, and not juſtifie himſelf. But perhaps with me it is of more difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that have affirmed, That reception hath ſtill ſomewhat at leaſt of action in it; but this reception here in queſtion, hath no
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:168215:235"/> more of action then ſerves to poſſeſſe it ſelf of a free gift; which ever adds honour to the giver, not to the receiver: I diſtinguiſh therefore of inſtruments <hi>of meer reception,</hi> and inſtruments <hi>of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther operation;</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Inſtruments of meer reception and further operation di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed.</note> that which is objected holds of inſtruments wholly operative, not of thoſe that are meerly receptive. A man receives a gift with his hand, as the lame man was ready to do, when he expected ſomething from <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John, Act.</hi> 3.5. and he earnes his living with his hand, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, when in ſome exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents his hands miniſtred to his neceſſities, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.34. In the former mans hand concurres to his enriching, but he enriches not himſelf, as in the later. The denomination is from the fountaine, whence all flowes, not from the hand that accepts, or the ciſtern that doth receive. There is added. <hi>In my judgement this doctrine ſhould not be made part of our Religion, nor much ſtreſſe laid on it, if it were true, becauſe it is ſo obſcure.</hi> It ſeems then that not I, but our <hi>Religion,</hi> is the author of this ſo high a contradiction; ſo that I cannot defend Religion, but I am put upon it to aſſert ſuch contradictions; and who layes greateſt ſtreſſe upon that which is not obſcure and dark, I leave to the Reader of Mr. <hi>Baxters Aphoriſmes</hi> and <hi>Apology</hi> to determine. It followes, <hi>That man concurres as a ready agent, who doubts? but doth that prove him, or his faith the efficient cauſe of his own pardon and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication?</hi> Do I, or doth our <hi>Religion</hi> make man or faith the efficient cauſe of his own pardon, and juſtification? Quote ſome words of mine or ſome Article of faith in any of the Proteſtant Confeſſions that affirmes it: were ſome others in my ſtead they would highly rhetoricate, and tell the world what would be ſaid when they are dead. But this is my comfort, when I am dead, <hi>Religion</hi> will ſtand up for its own defence: that the concurrence of a ready agent hath ſomewhat of efficiency in it, I think none can deny; and that ſuch concurrence that I have mentioned can riſe to be the efficient I think,<note place="margin">Faith is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument both of God and man in the work of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</note> very few will affirm. And to bring my ſelf into that which he before hand charges to be ſo abſurd, I ſaid, [And becauſe it is the inſtrument of man in a work of this nature, it is alſo the inſtrument of God. As ſome have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a communication of titles between Chriſt and his Church (the Church being called by his name): ſo there is a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of actions in theſe relative works. <hi>Chriſt dwells in our hearts by faith,</hi> Epheſ. 3.17. We believe, and not Chriſt: and yet [faith] there is Chriſts inſtrument, whereby he takes up his
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:168215:235"/> abode. <hi>God purifies the hearts of the Gentiles by faith,</hi> Act. 15.17. They believed and not God: yet faith is Gods inſtrument in the work of their purification. So on the other ſide the Spirit is Gods work: yet we by the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13.] Here Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> firſt takes in hand the thing that I aſſert, and when he hath done falls upon the proof which is firſt to quarrel with the concluſion, and then to take the premiſes into conſideration, 1. It is ſaid, <hi>If this be indeed true,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">God and man are not coordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate cauſes in Juſtification.</note> 
                              <hi>that it is mans inſtrument of juſtification, and Gods both, then both God and man are cauſae principales partiales by coordination, making up one principall cauſe;</hi> This he thinks I will not affirm, and this indeed I do deny upon the reaſons afore laid down, it is mans inſtrument for concurrence in it, but not of principall efficiency to produce it: In caſe I had affirmed, he gives in his reaſon of denyal of it in a Similitude of an abſolute donor, in which I grant the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore ſhall not trouble the Reader with it. As to the proof that I bring, he firſt excepts againſt that which I ſay, others have obſerved, and ſay: <hi>This communication of titles,</hi> 1. <hi>is very rare.</hi> 2. <hi>uncertain whether ever,</hi> and goeth about to take off that text, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. But this being Heterogeneous to the work in hand, I ſhall let his exceptions alone, only pointing him out one another text; with which if he pleaſe, he may take like pains, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.6. <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.16. Compared. After much ado to find out my meaning he reſolves: <hi>But it is like you intended to have ſaid, that there is a common or mutuall attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of each others actions, or one is intitled to the actions of the other: and ſo mean only a communication of the name quoad modum producendi, and not of the actions themſelves.</hi> And who but he, that would ſeek a knot in a Bul-ruſh could have thought of any other? but as the titles of one, are obſerved by ſome to be attributed to another; ſo the actions proper to one, are attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the other? Then a Dilemma is brought againſt me, <hi>either this is in an improper figurative way of ſpeech, or it is proper and grounded in the nature of the thing,</hi> and either of both is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt; I ſay the action of one is ſaid <hi>interpretative</hi> to be the action of the other, becauſe he makes uſe of it to do his own work, or bring about his own purpoſe. To the inſtance that I gave, [that Chriſt dwells in our hearts by faith] he ſaies there <hi>is not a word to prove that there is a relative indwelling.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> very well knowes that I did not oppoſe relative in this place
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:168215:236"/> to reall, as intending to hold forth any effect wrought by Chriſts indwelling: but the oppoſition is ſo abſolute, as I expreſt my ſelf. I do not ſay that juſtification is directly ſpoke to in that place, yet there is a proof I think ſufficient that Chriſt makes uſe of our act to effect his own work, which is as much as I intended elſewhere. Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> is ſo free as to yield that faith is an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to receive Chriſt,<note place="margin">How Chriſt is ſaid to dwell in us by faith.</note> but here he ſtickles hard to deny it, but let us take notice of his conceſſions: <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is ſaid to dwell in us by faith.</hi> 1. <hi>Formaliter, Faith being the principal part of that grace which dwelleth in us.</hi> And ſo we might ſay he dwells by Love, Hope, Meekneſſe, Patience, which I think no Scripture or Orthodox Writer ſayes. 2. <hi>Conditionaliter; Faith being a condition of our right to the Spirit abode.</hi> But it is ſo a condition as it is withall an inſtrumentall condition. It is not barely ſaid, if you believe, I will give you my Spirit; which might imply barely a condition, as it is ſaid, turn at my reproof, and I will pour out my Spirit upon you: but it is ſaid, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the promiſe of the Spirit by faith. 3. <hi>Efficienter. As the act of faith doth directly cauſe the encreaſe, and ſo the abode of the habit.</hi> And is it may we think a principal, or is it an inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal efficient? If an inſtrumental, I have what I deſire, and I am ſure he will not ſay it is a principal efficient. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is, I am ſure, as zealous as I can be to aſſert a conditionate Covenant: and if an adverſary be as ſtreight-laced to him, and me, in that, as he is to me in this; he will hardly prove a condition, either in the Covenant of works or grace. I will as ſoon find the word <hi>inſtrument</hi> in Scripture applyed to juſtification, as he ſhall find the word <hi>condition</hi> applyed to either Covenant. And he can name I think no word implying a condition that is alwayes put for a condition: and the context whereſoever we are ſaid to be juſtified <hi>by faith,</hi> or that Chriſt is a propitiation <hi>through faith,</hi> is in all indifferent Readers eyes as clear for an inſtrument in juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: as thoſe which he, and I, can bring (which yet are clear enough) for a conditionate Covenant. And that doctrine hath farre more adverſaries then this, though there is little cauſe that any man ſhould be an adverſary in either.</p>

I never had it in my thoughts that juſtification is expreſſely ſpoken to in any of theſe texts, nor was it my buſineſſe to find out any inſtrument in them, though I doubt not but that faith is ſpoken to inſtrument in two of them, and as a condition, non-inſtrumental in none of them; neither did I dream of making the Spirit an inſtrument. All that I intended was to prove,<note place="margin">The acts of God are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to man, and the acts of man to God in Scripture.</note> that the acts of man were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to God, and ſo the acts of God to man, not conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as the buſineſſe in hand let not to it) about what theſe acts are exerciſed: if they prove that, It is to me ſufficient, whether it be in Juſtification, Sanctification, Mortification, or any other work. There is added. 2. <hi>All this is nothing to the buſineſſe of juſtification;</hi> nothing directly, immediately, but much by way of Analogy. It is enough to prove, That, to be the inſtrument of man, and the inſtrument of God are not <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>. And if he deſire a proof more punctually applyed to juſtification, let him conſult, <hi>Rom</hi> 3.30. <hi>It is one God that ſhall juſtifie the circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by faith, and the uncircumciſion through faith;</hi> and, Gal. 3.8. <hi>The Scripture foreſeeing that God would juſtifie the Heathen through faith.</hi> Faith for juſtification is uſually aſcribed to man, being properly his act, and therefore that text of the Prophet, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. <hi>The juſt ſhall live by his faith,</hi> is by the Apoſtle more then once applyed to juſtification: And in the text now quoted, this act of faith is aſcribed to God, for that work. I explained my ſelf [man neither juſtifies, nor ſanctifies himſelf, yet by faith he is raiſed to cloſe with God in both] &amp;c. To this is anſwered, <hi>If man juſtifie not himſelf, and yet faith be his inſtrument of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, then farewell old Logick.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is the firſt great Logitian, that I ever heard talk ſo much of his Logick in the laſt Section but one we had it, and now we have it in the ſame thing again; there I ſhewed that old Logick may ſtand, and yet his conſequence not yeelded. 2. It is ſaid, <hi>If man ſanctifie not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under God, as to the progreſſe, and acts of ſanctification, then farewell old Theology.</hi> And if man may be ſaid to ſanctifie himſelf further then hath been ſaid, or ſo as to be a principal efficient (which will follow from Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> reaſonings) then welcome the neweſt Divinity. It will not be denyed, that a ſanctified
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:168215:237"/> man differs from one that is unſanctified, and then in caſe it may be allowed to ſay, I ſanctifie my ſelf: he may ſay; I make my ſelf to differ: which I never heard that any in direct termes would ſay againſt the Apoſtle, but <hi>Grevenchovius,</hi> as I find him cited by Dr. <hi>Featly,</hi> and yet it ſeems it is my great error, that I will not ſay ſo, I lift man up in that height in juſtification, as to pardon his own ſin, in holding that it is <hi>of faith,</hi> that it may be <hi>of grace,</hi> not <hi>of works leſt any ſhould boaſt;</hi> And I raiſe him not high enough in ſanctification, If I ſay no more then that by faith he receives power from God by the Spirit for it: that text, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. would farre better have ſerved my purpoſe, if I had firſt hit upon it;<note place="margin">The Spirit of God and not man, is to have the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination in ſanctification.</note> 
                              <hi>Seeing ye have purified your ſouls in obeying the truth through the Spirit.</hi> They that have done any thing in purifying their hearts through the Spirit, will rather entitle the Spirit of God, then themſelves to it, and will judge that he, rather then they ſhould be denominated a <hi>ſanctifier.</hi> And for other texts that are hinted, and one mentioned, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. To argue from the Command to the power, is that old Theologie, that I am ready to bid farewell to.

There followes. 4. <hi>When you ſay that [faith as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument receiveth righteouſneſſe to juſtification] you ſpeak exactly the conceptions of moſt Divines that I have met with, or read that go your way, and therefore theſe words deſerve a little further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and after ſome enquiry into their meaning,</hi> There is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>but theſe things muſt be more accurately conſidered I think.</hi> Here it is confeſſed, that I tread in the beaten road, and that I do appear in the common cauſe, and comparing what is here ſaid with that which in his concluſion he delivers:<note place="margin">The Author is confeſt to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the common cauſe in behalf of Proteſtants.</note> It appears that the Divines of this corner of the world for 1300. years paſt have all taken this way, which is all that go under the name Proteſtant, whether <hi>Calviniſt,</hi> or <hi>Lutheran,</hi> as they are wont to be diſtinguiſhed: I ſhall therefore expect, that ſome of thoſe

Having ſaid that theſe things are to be more accurately conſidered, he expreſſes himſelf without any one title of Scripture in eight particulars, I ſhall as briefly as I can take notice of the ſum of them.<note place="margin">Mr <hi>Faxters</hi> eight heads taken into conſideration.</note>
                           </p>
                           <p n="1">1. <hi>It muſt be known, that the righteouſneſſe given to us, is not the righteouſneſſe whereby Chriſts perſon was righteous, (for accidents periſh being removed from the ſubject) but it is a righteouſneſs me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited by Chriſts ſatisfaction, and obedience for us.</hi> Here we have a negation with its reaſons, and an oppoſite affirmation, without any reaſon at all. The negation is, That the righteouſneſſe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us is not the righteouſneſſe whereby Chriſts perſon was righteous. The reaſon is, <hi>Accidents periſh being removed from the ſubject,</hi> and therefore the righteouſneſſe given us is not the righteouſneſſe whereby Chriſts perſon was righteous; impliying that the <hi>reformed</hi> party take righteouſneſſe for juſtification out of Chriſt (and leave him belike without any righteouſneſſe) and put it into themſelves; and ſo as Chriſt was before, ſo now they are inherently righteous. He well knowes that they hold, that it is ſtill in Chriſt, and of grace reckoned to be ours; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that of accidents periſhing needed not an opinion which he vehemently oppoſeth in his Preface to his Confeſſion. <hi>If Chriſt onely</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>were righteous, Chriſt onely would be reputed, and judged righteous, and Chriſt onely would be happy. The Judge of the world will not juſtifie the unrighteous, meerly becauſe another is righteous; nor can the holy Ghoſt take complacency in an unholy ſinner, becauſe another is holy.</hi> And yet himſelf holds, That the Judge of the world, will not onely take an infant born under the defilement of ſin into Covenant as holy; but alſo juſtifie him (though in his opinion uncapable of any real change by the Spirit) barely upon the account of the parents ſtate in grace through regeneration. We cannot be righteous through Chriſts righteouſneſſe, notwithſtanding we know, that in the Goſpel of grace, it is reckoned ours, and by faith have our intereſt. Yet an infant is righteous by the parents rigteouſneſſe: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding we read not of any ſuch imputation, or any ſuch way, of intereſt by faith or otherwiſe: I muſt crave leave to
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:168215:238"/> hold to the former which he leaves, though not with his, but Scripture comment upon it. God does not juſtifie us, meerly becauſe another is righteous; but becauſe Chriſt <hi>is made of God to us righteouſneſſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. and is <hi>Jehovah our righteouſneſſe</hi> Jer. 23.6. And to leave the latter which he holds: I believe neither regeneration nor juſtification to be from Parent to child <hi>ex Traduce.</hi> In which ſenſe that holds, <hi>Nemo naſcitur, ſed fit Chriſtianus.</hi> I chooſe rather with <hi>Walaeus</hi> to ſubſcribe to the opinion of <hi>Calvin,</hi> lib. 4. inſtit. cap. 16. Sect. 20. That In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are baptized into future Repentance and faith: which he ſaies is the opinion of moſt other Authors. I believe Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> chiefly took up this opinion of juſtification of infants, <hi>tanquam Apendices parentum,</hi> for <hi>Amiraldus</hi> his ſake, who had it from <hi>Camero,</hi>

                           <p n="3">3. His ſatisfaction is diſtinguiſhed from this righteouſneſſe, when I think it is plain, that it ſelf is righteouſneſſe; Chriſts own as a Redeemer; Ours as redeemed ones; when Chriſt had taken upon him our ſins, he had not ſtood righteous in Gods ſight, without a diſcharge, and this diſcharge is our acquittal and deliverance.</p>

In this whole piece we have an affirmation, a negation, a conceſſion and illuſtration.<note place="margin">Our Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing terminated on Chriſt, it is terminated on righteouſneſſe.</note> For the affirmation, that faith is terminated on Chriſt, we grant; but that it is not therefore terminated on the righteouſneſſe which he gives in remiſſion, (for remiſſion I think was intended) we are to learn: And when it is granted, that remiſſion is the end, (which is ill confounded with righteouſneſſe, one being the cauſe, the other the effect) it muſt be granted, that a righteous Chriſt is the object, and that Chriſt is received upon account of his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe; were not this an <hi>accurate</hi> way of diſtinguiſhing, to ſay, that a man ready to periſh with cold, goes to the fire, and not to heat, for warmth; The heart ready to periſh with thirſt; goeth to the water, and not to moiſture; If the ſoul ready to periſh in unrighteouſneſſe, goes to Chriſt for righteouſneſſe, his faith cannot be terminated on Chriſt, but it muſt be terminated on righteouſneſſe, as the eye cannot be fixed on the ſunne, but it muſt be fixed on light. We are holpen with a ſimilitude. <hi>As a woman doth not marry a mans riches, but the man; Though it may be her end in marrying the man, to be enriched by him; nor is her receiving his riches the condition of her first Legal right to them, but her taking the man for her huſband.</hi> If Chriſt and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe were ſeparable, as a man and riches are, this ſimile might be to ſome purpoſe, ſo that a man might be married, and poverty continued; but Chriſt cannot be received and a ſtate of unrighteouſneſſe remain.

                           <p n="4">4. <hi>Chriſts ſatisfaction or redemption</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſolvendo pretium and merit cannot be properly received by us: for they are not in themſelves given to us (but as tropically they may be ſaid to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to us, becauſe the fruit of them is given us) It was not to us, but to God, that Chriſt gave ſatisfaction, and the price of our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:168215:240"/> And yet juſtifying faith doth as neceſſarily reſpect Chriſts ſatisfaction and merit, as it doth our juſtification thereby procured. It is therefore the acknowledging of this redemption, ſatisfaction or merit, and the receiving of Chriſt as one that hath redeemed us by ſatisfaction and merit, and not the receiving that ſatisfaction or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption our ſelves,</hi> &amp;c. If Chriſt gave ſatisfaction to God,<note place="margin">How Chriſts ſatisfaction to God for us, is receiued by us.</note> he yet gave it for us, and God accounts it ours: <hi>In him we have redemption through his blood,</hi> Epheſ. 1.7. If we have it in him, ſome way we come by it. And how we come by it, if we do not receive it, I cannot imagine. As the Sonne gives himſelf for our ranſome to the Father; So the Father gives the Sonne to us. I marvell what comment will be put upon the words of the inſtitution of the Lords Supper, <hi>Take eat this is my body which is broken for you;</hi> as it is broken for us; ſo it is given to us and ſo of the Cup, <hi>This is my blood in the New Teſtament ſhed for you, and for many for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Chriſt and ſatisfaction wrought by Chriſt, Chriſt and redemption wrought by Chriſt are both received, ſeeing Chriſt is made unto us redemption, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. and faith is our way of receipt.</p>

The apprehenſion of nothing elſe is the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying act, but that there needs diſtinct acts of faith to receive other mercies, does not follow upon this principle, which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſo far as I underſtand him in the following words hath proved, when it lay on his hand to diſprove. Having mentioned ſeveral Sciptures, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. he addes as a reſult from all, <hi>So that one entire faith is the condition of our right,</hi>

                           <p n="6">6. <hi>It muſt be remembred</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the thing that faith receives naturally and properly, is not Chriſt himſelf, or his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe; but the ſpecies of what is repreſented as its object; And that faiths reception of Chriſt himſelf, and his righteouſneſſe, or of right to him, is but receptio metaphorica, vel actio ad receptionem propriam neceſſaria: and that the true reception which is pati, non agere, doth follow faith. And therefore Chriſt himſelf is received, onely Receptione fide ethicâ, activâ, metaphoricâ: species Chriſti praedicati recipitur receptione naturali, intelligendo: Jus ad Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum recipitur receptione naturali paſſivâ, propriâ.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> friend let him know that he underſtood not his former, I would I had acquaintance with him to help me in this; for if he had not underſtood him here, he would likely have ſaid as much as before; unleſſe perhaps his modeſty would not ſuffer him to be ſo much on the excepting hand.

Neither is Juſtification by motion, as is warmth, but by imputations. And if it were by motion, it were moſt improperly aſcrib'd to faith. Neither is motion to a thing, the thing it ſelf: nor doth a dispoſition obtain any thing, but is the way to obtain it: Therefore faith do's not juſtifie by any motion of dispoſition,</hi> Pareus in Rom 3. Dub. 8. The reaſon of this is, <hi>That this is onely donation, or the will of the donour ſignified, that can efficiently convey a right to his own bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits; the receiver is not the giver, and therefore not the conveyer of right.</hi> I wonder what this is a reaſon of; if it be intended for a reaſon of that which goeth immediately befote, that faith doth morally qualifie in the way mentioned, it is above me to ſee any reaſon in it. It is further ſaid, <hi>Every inſtrument is an efficient cauſe, and therefore muſt effect; and it is onely giving that effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this right.</hi> But it effects no ſuch right without receiving, where it is given upon that proviſo, that it be thus and thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. After much ado, and to what purpoſe, let others judge. The concluſion is: <hi>The great thing therefore that I affirm is this, that if you will needs call faith the inſtrument of apprehending Chriſt, or righteouſneſſe, yet doth it not juſtifie proxime &amp; forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:168215:243"/> as ſuch, but as the condition of the gift performed.</hi> And the great thing that I would affirm, is, That the inſtrumental appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending Chriſt, or righteouſneſſe, is this condition of the gift; It is given upon condition that we make uſe of our faith to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it; and ſo the ſumme is, That faith doth not juſtifie <hi>formaliter &amp; proxime,</hi> as apprehending Chriſt, or righteouſneſſe, becauſe it doth juſtifie <hi>proxime &amp; formaliter</hi> as thus apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Faith as a condition certainly doth ſomewhat, and this it is that it doth according to the Scripture.</p>
                           <p>The eighth and laſt of his <hi>accurate</hi> heads followes. In which he ſaies, he opens his meaning together, about this point, though as he ſaies with ſome repetitions. I cannot then without repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions give any further anſwer, which to the Reader would be too troubleſome, yet ſomewhat is obſervable that I find not before. <hi>Faith</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>muſt firſt be faith,</hi> i. e. <hi>apprehenſio Chriſti, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature before it can be the condition of right.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Actual exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the being of a condition in a Covenant.</note> If faith muſt have an actual being before it can be the condition of right, then perfect obedience (according to the old rule, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> calls it) muſt firſt be perfect obedience in actual being, before it can be a condition of the Covenant of works, and ſo it will follow that, that Covenant hath no condition, ſeeing there is no ſuch actual obedience. A condition may be a condition, though not made good, though never made good. The delivery in of an hundred foreskins of the Philiſtines was <hi>Davids</hi> condition for Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of <hi>Sauls</hi> daughter before any Philiſtine was ſlain, and had ſtood as a condition though had never been given in. If he mean, that faith muſt be faith, before the condition be made good, this is falſe: for the actual being of it is the making of it good; and ſo it is as much as if I ſaid, I muſt wink in order of nature before I ſhut my eyes. He further diſtinguiſhes of <hi>apprehenſio Chriſti,</hi> and <hi>conditio praeſtita,</hi> when <hi>apprehenſio Chriſti</hi> is <hi>conditio praeſtita;</hi> as though I ſhould diſtinguiſh between <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> ſacrificing of his ſon, and his obedience of Gods command in ſacrificing him, when all know that his ſacrificing him was his obedience. To ſay that there is ſuch a thing as faith in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral notion before Chriſt doth conſtitute a condition, were ſomewhat; but to ſay that we believe, or apprehend Chriſt before we perform the condition, is to ſay we muſt perform the condition before we perform it.</p>
                           <p>Having led the Reader through all this <hi>accurateneſſe,</hi> I muſt
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:168215:243"/> further conſider his animadverſions. I ſaid, [The Spirit will do nothing without our faith, and our faith can do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spirit; man cannot juſtifie himſelf by believing without God, and God will not juſtifie an unbelieving man; faith then is the act of man; man believes, yet the inſtrument of God that juſtifies onely believers.] To which I have a multiplication either of anſwers and ſcornes in place of anſwers. 1. It is ſaid. <hi>The Spirits working in ſanctification is nothing to our queſtion of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> It is yet ſomewhat for illuſtration, for which alone it was brought, though nothing for proof for which it was never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. 2. It is ſaid. <hi>The Spirit works our firſt faith without faiths coworking, and that is more then nothing.</hi> What need he to have told me this, when I had told it him before? as the Reader may ſee in words which he omits; I ſpeak there of the Spirits work in the ſoul where faith is implanted. 3. <hi>The Spirit moveth faith to action before faith moveth it ſelf.</hi> Here is an exception to fill up the number. If I move my pen to write, before it move, then I write ſomething without my pen. 4. It is ſaid. <hi>It is not ſo eaſily proved as ſaid, That the Spirit never exciteth any good act in the ſoul, nor yet reſtraineth from any evill without the cowor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of faith.</hi> But why is not this diſproved with eaſe? I would know for my learning, what act of the Spirit upon a beleeving ſoul is mentioned in Scripture, which is not aſcribed alſo to faith. The Spirit mortifies the deeds of the fleſh, ſo doth faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9. Devils are caſt out by the Spirit of God, ſo they are caſt out by faith, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9 The Spirit is our ſtrength in the inward man, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.16. and faith is our ſtrength, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20. All things are poſſible to the Spirit of God; And all things are poſſible to him that beleeves, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.23. The Spirits me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod laid down in the Word is not to work in us reſpective to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation (after the grace of faith is implanted) without us; what is aſcribed to the one as the efficient, is ordinary aſcribed to the other as the inſtrument. But theſe anſwers he confeſſes are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the point; This ſimile might therefore have eſcaped this quarrel; in the two next he will ſure then be ſo punctual, that all Readers ſhall ſay, <hi>Rem acu tetigiſti.</hi> 5. It is added. <hi>When you have laid down one propoſition, Man cannot juſtifie himſelf by belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving without God, how fairly do you lay down this as the diſjunct propoſition? And God will not juſtifie an unbelieving man, who would have thought, but you would rather have ſaid, Nor will God juſtify
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:168215:244"/> man unleſſe his faith be the inſtrument of it? and do you not ſeem to imply that man without God, doth juſtifie himſelf, when you ſay man cannot juſtifie himſelf by believing without God? No, nor with him neither, for none can forgive ſins but God onely, even to another; but who can forgive himſelf?</hi> I think all is laid down ſo fairly, that were I to lay it down again, I ſhould not lay it down in Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> words. <hi>Nor will God juſtifie a man unleſſe faith be the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> he would then ſoon have challenged it as a <hi>petitio principii,</hi> ſeeing it is that which is in queſtion; I might have ſaid that God will not juſtify a man except he diſclaim his own righteouſneſſe, and accept of Chriſts righteouſneſſe to juſtification; but that which I did ſay is the ſame with any friend, or fair adverſary, and ſo it is a diſjunct propoſition fairly laid down, and I imply that which I ſpeak; and if any will have it further expreſſed, God will not juſtifie man without the concurrence of his faith. There fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes; <hi>In deed I have thought what a ſad caſe the Pope is in, that is the onely man on earth that hath no viſible pardoner of his ſin: he can forgive others; but who ſhall forgive him?</hi> It ſeems by this jeſt that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is willing to put off that he is not ſo good a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in Popiſh myſteries, as by Mr <hi>Crandon</hi> he ſtands charged; otherwiſe he could not but know that the Pope hath his pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as well as others.<note place="margin">The Pope hath his viſible par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doner as well as receivers.</note> He gives power for the pardon of ſin, as the ſuppoſed head of the Church, by application of the ſuperero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated merits of the Saints, together with the merits of Chriſt, out of the treaſure of the Church, of which he hath the keys. Now he ſinnes as a man, and receives pardon as a Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and to that purpoſe hath his confeſſor, A man as viſible as other men. And ſpeaking of his ſad condition on this ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he ſeems to lay farre more ſtreſſe on the pardons of Rome then they themſelves; as though he ſtood in ſome eminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of hell upon the want of ſuch a pardon, when he might know that according to their principles, all his danger is, an abode ſome longer time in Purgatory, which is their trimming place in the way to heaven. For if the pardon find him in a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſinne (which alone is deſerving of hell) it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inefficacious; mortall ſinne puts a barre to the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. It is the temporal puniſhment which this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don remits, and not the eternal; and in caſe it were true that this could not be done to the Pope, there being none above him, his ſucceſſor with a wet finger can do it for him.
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:168215:244"/> As to that which was forgotten, it had been to his honour if it had never been remembred. <hi>I forgot</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that every believer forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth himſelf, for I did not believe it.</hi> Such ſarcaſmes befit not grave Writers, eſpecially when all <hi>Reformers</hi> (to ſpeak in his own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage) muſt bear a ſhare in the contumely; when they had it in their thoughts, in this way to imitate the Apoſtle in giving all to grace, and taking all from man, that one would riſe out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to make this ſport with it. It followes, 6. <hi>How nakedly is it again affirmed without the leaſt proof, that our faith is Gods inſtrument in juſtifying? doth God effect our Juſtification by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental efficient cauſation of our faith?</hi> If this were my fault, yet Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> of all men is moſt unfit to give it in charge; other men muſt have a proof for every word, but he himſelf may heap up diſtinctions, propoſitions, concluſions, without any colour of proof at all: where is his proof of that which in the laſt Section, number 6. <hi>muſt be remembred?</hi> and of that <hi>great thing,</hi> num. 7. he would deſire ſhould be obſerved? I ſuppoſe he will have ten to remember, and obſerve, before one to believe it. Others can ſee proof, and ſend their Reader hither for proof, though he cannot find it. My work was to ſhew, that though it be mans act, yet God may make uſe of it as inſtrumentally ſerviceable in this work; and whether this hath been nakedly ſaid, or proved, let the diſ-intereſted Reader give his ſentence; if that which I have ſaid will not ſatisfie, let Mr. <hi>Burges</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted in his late Treatiſe of Juſtifica. Part 2. I conclude, [That which is here ſpoken by way of exception againſt faith as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, holds of efficients and inſtruments ſole and abſolute in their work and cauſality; but where there is a concurrence of agents, and one makes uſe of the act of another to produce the effect that in ſuch cauſality is wrought, it will not hold.] To this is anſwered, <hi>He that will or can make him a Religion of words or ſyllables, that either ſignifie nothing, or are never like to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the learner, let him make this an article of his faith, what you mean by abſolute, I cannot certainly ariolate. Bona verba bono viro deſunt.</hi> Seeing I find the man in this mood, I ſay no more; but ſeeing he knowes not how to ariolate, what I mean by this, or that, I have no mind to help him in this art of ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying, and ſhall let the words ſtand for their uſe, that bring a mind to underſtand, rather then to exerciſe their wit to carp at what they read.</p>

                           <head>Of the ſole ſufficiency of the grant of the new Covenant, as an inſtrument in juſtification.</head>
                           <p>I ſhall now leave to the Readers conſideration, whether Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> exceptions againſt the inſtrumentality of faith in juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, be of that validity, as to overthrow it, and whether his doctrine of this ſubject be of that clearneſſe, as to accuſe the doctrine of his adverſaries (which are all <hi>Reformers;</hi> Forreign, and Engliſh) of ſuch notable obſcurity. I muſt now look into that which he hath ſaid; for the ſole-ſufficiency of the grant of the new Covenant of the Goſpel to ſtand in ſtead of faith for an inſtrument in this work. And if I meet with no more ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this, then in the former; I muſt crave leave to ſay, that I have very little in either. I ſaid in my Treatiſe of the Covenant. [The promiſe or grant of the new Covenant in the Goſpel, is inſtead of faith made the inſtrument in the work of juſtification] adding, [This is indeed Gods, and not mans: It is the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God, the promiſe of God, the Goſpel of God: but of it ſelf unable to raiſe up man to juſtification.] To which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> replyes. <hi>I ſay there is none but Gods, for</hi> non datur inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum, quod non eſt cauſae principalis inſtrumentum. And I ſay ſtill that God acts not in this work, without the concurrence of him that is juſtified, which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> grants; And this concurrence of man having its inſtrument,<note place="margin">In juſtification of man, God acts not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out man.</note> God thereby doth carry on his work; otherwiſe the Apoſtle had not onely ſaid, that <hi>God is a juſtifier, of thoſe that believe in Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 3.26. but alſo that <hi>he juſtifies the circumciſion by faith, and the uncircumſion through faith.</hi> And this act of man is <hi>interpretativè,</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of God, but more directly and properly the inſtrument of man; where I ſay it is of it ſelf unable to raiſe up man to juſtification; he gives in his anſwer. In which we have: Firſt, his conceſſion, what of it ſelf it is not able to do. Secondly, his aſſertion, what of it ſelf it can do. Thirdly, his explication under what notion it doth it. His conceſſion is, <hi>That it is not of it ſelf able to do all other works antecedent to juſtification,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> conceſſion.</note> 
                              <hi>as to humble, to give faith, regenerate, &amp;c.</hi> But he doth not tell us from whence it hath any ſupply for thoſe antedaneous works, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be employed in thoſe works at all. His aſſertion is, that <hi>as to the act of juſtification,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">His aſſertion.</note> 
                              <hi>or conveying right to Chriſt, pardon, and righteouſneſſe, it is able of it ſelf.</hi> But it is worth our enquiry, to
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:168215:245"/> whom this new Covenant grant doth convey right to Chriſt, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and righteouſneſſe, whether to the unhumbled, unbelieving, unregenerate, or to the humble, believing, and regenerate ſoul? The former are not in a preſent capacity of him, and the latter are already in poſſeſſion; if he can find me an humble, believing, regenerate man void of all right to Chriſt, pardon, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, I will confeſſe that the grant of the new Covenant is of it ſelf able to do what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſayes. I looked that he ſhould have proved, that the grant of the new Covenant in the Goſpel doth this <hi>conſtitutivè</hi> as he uſeth to ſpeak, That it ſhould work an unjuſtified man up to a juſtified ſtate; but it ſeems he will have it to do it onely <hi>declarative,</hi> to make it appear that he is already juſtified, which honours is very low, and that about which I intend not to raiſe diſputes; If I miſtake him, and that he will ſay, that he means more then a naked declaration. I would he would explaine himſelf and ſpeak out what more it is that he inteds; for if he intend more, I know not how to help him out of an high contradiction, ſeeing he talkes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance right to them that all know are poſſeſſed before-hand of right. The ſame Goſpel-grant which works thoſe antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daneous acts of which he ſpeaks, doth together convey right to all thoſe in whom ſuch a work is found. It is able to do it of it ſelf (as he explaines himſelf) ac <hi>ſignum voluntatis divinae,</hi> but where is it revealed from God, that either the unhumbled, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, unregenerate, ſhall have right to Chriſt, pardon, juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or that the humble, believing, regenerate want it? Faith with Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is <hi>an acceptance of a freely given Chriſt, and life in him,</hi> how doth a man in faith ſtand in need of a new conveyance of right to him? There followes; <hi>If you ſhould mean that [that of it ſelf] i. e. without the concomitance of faith as a condition is not able;</hi> I anſwer, <hi>that is not fitly called diſablity; or if you will ſo call it, the reaſon of that diſability is not, becauſe there is a neceſſity of faiths inſtrumentall coefficiency, but of its preſence, as the performed condition: It being the will of the donor that his grant ſhould not efficere actualites till the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were performed.</hi> This aſſertion, That there is no efficiency in faith, but a naked preſence to ſtand by, and as it were to look on in the work of juſtification, calls for ſome proof: ſeeing he well knowes that among all <hi>Reformers</hi> his adverſaries, this will paſſe for ſo high a Paradox. How is Chriſt <hi>a propitiation through
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:168215:246"/> faith?</hi> and how are we ſtill ſaid to be juſtified by faith? If no more then a bare preſence is required, the preſence of other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is equally required; as love, meekneſſe, temperance, chaſtity, they have ſtill been confeſt neceſſary in juſtification, <hi>quoad preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam,</hi> though not <hi>quoad efficientiam:</hi> yet Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> can I think, no where ſhew, that Chriſts is ſet forth a propitiation through any one of theſe graces: or that we are juſtified by love, meekneſſe, temperance, &amp;c. I ſhall as ſoon believe that the preſence of the eye is barely required for ſight, without further efficiency, as I ſhall believe that the bare preſence of faith is required, and no more for juſtification: and where he will will prove that it is the will of the Donor, that his grant ſhould not <hi>efficere actualiter</hi> till the condition be performed, (intending as he expreſſeth himſelf, that after the condition is performed a new grant muſt paſſe actualy to effect this right) I cannot tell, when the condition is to accept Chriſt which is preſent poſſeſſion. They cannot take Chriſt for juſtification, but by virtue of this grant: and when they have thus taken him, and are poſſeſt of him, muſt they have a new grant for right to him? If I give a begger a gift, upon condition that he will come, and take it: when he hath taken it, and is poſſeſt of it, hath he need of any further grant of right to it? I ſaid, [It is often tendered, and juſtication not alwayes wrought, and ſo diſabled from the office of an inſtrument by <hi>Keckerman,</hi> in his Comment on his firſt Canon concerning an inſtrument; As ſoon as the inſtrument ſerves not the principal agent, ſo ſoon it loſeth the nature of an inſtrument,] mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning inſtances that he gives, and adding, neither is the Goſpel an inſtrument of juſtification where it juſtifies not. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> being gotten into a vein that he hath not yet a mind to leave, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes; <hi>I am too ſhallow to reach the reaſon of theſe words; I know you had not leiſure to write them in vain, and meerly to fill paper.</hi> 1. I may fear there was a worſe end in the reply, then barely to fill paper: In contentions of this nature it is eaſie for great wits, voluble tongues, and nimble pens, to be more then vain. And here is ſcarce fair declaring to cut off my words before any full period, and ſo render them to the Reader; That my meaning cannot be ſeen, till he have gone over three or four Sections in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlaced with needleſſe triflings. 2. If Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> know (as he ſayes) that I will not own ſuch an argumentation as he there frames, without ſo much as colour of ſenſe in it, which were vain
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:168215:246"/> to repeat, what was his end, but meerly to fill up paper, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what worſe, in framing of it? A Reader of half Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> wit, if he look on my words as they lye in my Treatiſe, and not as mangled by his diviſions, may eaſily ſee another way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, and ſuch that carries ſenſe; and I leave to the Reader, whether or no it carries ſtrength. And for his ſatisfaction,<note place="margin">Tht Authors argument againſt the ſole-ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant grace, as inſtrument in juſtification.</note> I thus put it into forme. That which often failes of obtaining the end, for which it is employed, and never can attain to it, without the concurrence of ſome other with it, is no ſole inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in any work: But the Goſpel or Covenant-grant often failes of attaining that end of juſtification, when it is to that end publiſhed, and imployed, and never can obtain it without the concurrence of ſomewhat further to be joyned with it: <hi>Ergo</hi> it is no ſole inſtrument in the work. Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> ſignifies that it may ſtill be the ſame thing, and have the ſame aptitude to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the effect, even when it is not applyed. I anſwer, then Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> hath well told him it is an inſtrument <hi>aptitudinaliter,</hi> and is no inſtrument in actual being, but when the end is obtained, and then it is no ſole inſtrument, being not ſole in producing the effect. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> takes it for granted, that it alwayes hath its effect when it is employed, and I took it for granted, that it is often employed, and the effect not, produced; but I did not then think, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had meant, an application to convey right, where right is already in poſſeſſion. I added, [When the Miniſter is a Miniſter of condemnation, and the ſavour of death to death, there the Goſpel becomes an inſtrument of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and death, and ſo comes ſhort of juſtification.] To this is replyed, 1. <hi>So it is, if there be no Miniſter where it is known any way.</hi> 2. <hi>I ſpeak of Gods grant, or promiſe in the Goſpel: you ſpeak of his commination.</hi> 3. <hi>If the threat be the proper inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of condemnation à pari, the promiſe, or gift is the proper inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of juſtification.</hi> I grant his firſt, and he threapes kindneſſe with me in the two laſt; he will have me to ſpeak of the threat onely, when I ſpeak as well as he of Gods grant or promiſe:<note place="margin">Goſpel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are a ſavour of death to many.</note> This is a ſavour of death unto death unto many. It is as great an evil to ſleight a Promiſe, as to diſobey a Command, or neglect a threatning: his third therefore migt well have been ſpared: but that I intend not to trifle away time, I could eaſily ſhew him if I had ſpoke of threat, a great diſparity. I added, which ſhould not have come in thus diſmembred) [The efficacy that is in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:168215:247"/> for juſtification it receives by their faith to whom it is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.] To this is replyed, <hi>Darkly, but dangerouſly ſpoken,</hi> and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons given. <hi>For it is poſſible you may mean, that it receives it by faith, as by a condition,</hi> ſine qua homo non eſt ſubjuctum proxime capax, <hi>and ſo I grant the ſenſe.</hi> There is no poſſiblity, that I ſhould mean ſo, having ſufficiently (as he after obſerves) declared my ſelf to the contrary, if I underſtand his <hi>ſine qua non</hi> frequently found in his writings; which men eminently learned profeſſe they do not. It followes, <hi>Dangerouſly; for the words would ſeem to any impartial Reader to import more,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Goſpel receives its efficacy from faith, or by faith as the inſtrument which conveyeth that efficacy to the Goſpel.</hi> It is my meaning that the word is inefficacious without faith, and that faith renders it efficacious, not by infuſion of any new power into it, but raiſing up the ſoul with ſtrength to anſwer it, which is not barely ſaid, but proved: But my bare ſpeech muſt firſt be cenſured, and then my proof in a diſjunct way at pleaſure (as we ſhall ſee) dealt with. A reaſon is rendred, why for the truths ſake, and my own, theſe words have never been ſeen. <hi>For if faith give the Goſpel its efficacy,</hi> 1. <hi>It cannot be as a concauſe inſtrumental, coordinate, but as a ſuperiour more principal cauſe to the ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</hi> By Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> leave I do believe that concauſes inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental may receive efficacy one from another. The thred hath efficacy from a needle, and is a concauſe inſtrumental to ſow up a rent, or to make a ſeam or hem. The line gives effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy to the anglers hook to take a fiſh. I believe he hath ſeen a knife touched with a Loadſtone, fetch up a needle from the bottome of a veſſel of water. Here the hand is the principall agent, or the man uſing his hand: The knife is the inſtrument, yet ſuch an inſtrument as receives efficacy from the ſpirits of the Loadſtone, as a concauſe inſtrumental. The Goſpel works no more without faith, then a knife in this thing can work without a Loadſtone. It followes, 2. <hi>If it were the former that is meant, yet it were intolerable;</hi> For which reaſons are given; but how theſe hang together, I know not. His former (now ſpoken to) was brought in as the firſt in order to diſprove what I had ſaid, taking my words in the ſecond ſenſe which he gives of them; and this which is in order the ſecond, is to ſhew by three reaſons, that in caſe they be taken in the firſt ſenſe, which he himſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly grants, yet it were intolerable; ſeeing therefore that I
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:168215:247"/> take it not in that ſenſe, (and if I did, he grants the ſenſe) there is no cauſe that I ſhould trouble my ſelf with his Reaſons. I added, in way of proof, [<hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. Unto us was the Goſpel preached, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.12, 13.] To which is replyed, <hi>But where's your concluſion, or any ſhew of advantage to your cauſe?</hi> I muſt ſpeak nothing, it ſeems, but ſyllogiſmes in form; and he that cannot here make up a ſyllogiſme, and find out a formall concluſion, is a very Infant in Logick. <hi>In the firſt Text, the Apoſtle</hi> (as he ſayes) <hi>speaks of the Words profiting in the reall change of the ſoul, and our queſtion is of the relative.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Heb. 4.2. Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated.</note> And what ſhew of proof is there, that it is ſo underſtood of a real change, as wholly to exclude that which is relative? It is meant of that, whatſoever, which tends to the ſoules profit; It is ſpoken of profit in order to eternal reſt; If Juſtification be for our profit, or tend at all to our everlaſting reſt, then juſtification is not here excluded. It followes, <hi>The Scripture meaneth, The Word had not further work on the heart as it hath in them that mix it with faith; will you interpret it thus, The Word did not juſtifie?</hi> If I take this to be the meaning, I muſt interpret it, That the Word did not juſtifie them; for it doth juſtifie where it is mixt with faith, though I ſhould not exclude other offices done by the Word. It followes, 2. <hi>It's true that the Word did not juſtifie them, but that is conſequential onely of the former unprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> I might as well ſay, that the Word's not ſanctifying is conſequential; as he may ſay, the Word's not juſtifying is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus conſequential. I ſee no ſhew of reaſon, that the Text ſhould be meant immediately of ſanctification, and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially onely of Juſtification; and if it be conſequentially onely proved, that the Word did not juſtifie Them, here is a reall, and more then a ſhew of advantage to my cauſe. I hope he is not the man that will diſpute againſt proofs by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, when the conſequence by himſelf is granted. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes; <hi>Once prove that man is but as much efficient in juſtifying himſelf, as he is in the obedience and change of his mind or actions, and then you do ſomething.</hi> When I go about the proof of it, I think I ſhall have Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> my ſole and ſingle adverſary in it, he is not pleaſed to give us in any difference. And he ownes that which is uſually quoted out of <hi>Auſtin, He that made thee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thee, will not ſave thee without thee;</hi> and hath not juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as great an influx into ſalvation, as ſanctification? I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:168215:248"/> him onely to reflect upon that which he hath ſaid in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of his confeſſion, (a book newly come to my hands) <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently to believing all have an equal conditional gift of pardon, and none have an abſolute, nor an actual right; The Gospel findeth us equal, and makes no inequality, till we make it our ſelves; But the ſecret unſearchable workings of Divine grace do begin the difference, and make it in us, before it be made by us.</hi> Who ever went higher in ſpeaking of mans work in his ſanctification? and higher it is, then ever I ſpake of a mans pardoning himſelf. It is ſaid, <hi>It is weak arguing, to ſay the Word profiteth not, becauſe it was not mixt with faith, therefore faith conveyes to it its efficacy of ſanctifying, yea, of juſtifying, you cannot but know the ſequel would be denyed.</hi> Others would think, that there is ſtrength in ſuch arguing, that it receives efficacy from faith, upon that account, that it profits where faith is, and is unprofitable where faith is not; eſpecially when they find efficacy aſcribed to faith both in juſtification and ſanctification. It followes, <hi>In progreſſive ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, and obedience, and exerciſe of graces, the Word and faith are concauſes, and one will not effect without the other.</hi> And are not the Word and faith concauſes in Juſtification, as in progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſanctification? tell us whether you will exclude? I dare exclude neither faith nor Goſpel, as inſtrumental workers. <hi>But it followes not,</hi> as is ſaid, <hi>that therefore faith gives efficacy to the Word in this, for concauſes have not influence on each other, but on the effect.</hi> I ſcarce think that maxime to be of univerſal truth; but be it a truth, I ſay no more, then here is aſſerted for me; Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification is the effect, and the Word and faith are concauſes. It yet followes, <hi>The want of faith may hinder the Word from that further work on the ſoul, which preſuppoſeth faith, and that's all that the Text ſaith.</hi> If any ſenſe can be made of this arguing, ſo far as I underſtand it, then Juſtification preſuppoſeth not faith, which is not Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> judgment. It followes, <hi>May not the abſence of faith hinder, unleſſe when preſent it doth effect?</hi> And would the Apoſtle (think we) have ſpoke of effectual faith, or the efficacy of faith? yea, would Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> have wrote a Tract of effectual faith, if it had been idle in the ſoul, and without all efficacy? And to reſtrain the efficacy of it to ſanctification, excluding Juſtification, never came, that I know, into the thoughts of any Orthodox Writer, that hath treated of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; neither would the Pen-men of Scriptures have expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:168215:248"/> themſelves in that way; as to ſay we are <hi>juſtified by faith,</hi> had faith been there, and onely had ſate idle. The various ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of that Text, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. <hi>[The juſt ſhall live by his faith]</hi> may teach us, not to pen up faith in ſuch narrow bounds, as to reſtrain the work of it to efficacy in one kind onely. The Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> plainly applyes it to ſupport by faith in ſufferings, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.11. to juſtification by faith; and ſhall we ſay, that in the one, it is working; and in the other, it doth nothing? If we do, we ſhall have <hi>Paul</hi> our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, who ſayes that Chriſt is ſet forth a propitiation <hi>by faith:</hi> what followes, hath been already ſpoken to. <hi>The ſecond Text,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I know not how you mean to make uſe of, unleſſe you argue thus, The Word worketh effectually onely in believers, therefore faith conveyeth efficacy to the Word. I think I need not tell you,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that I deny the ſequel; not to speak of the antecedent, nor yet to tell you that this ſpeaks not of working the relative change of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification:</hi> He had a good mind to ſpeak to the antecedent, but if he can for diſproof of that, make any efficacious working of the Word appear in Infidels, ſuch as Scripture uſeth to honour with ſuch titles, I ſhall oppoſe him, to maintain the Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Infidels. The ſequel in the word <hi>[convey]</hi> is his own; and to that which followes, I have already ſufficiently ſpoken.</p>
                           <p>I inferred from the former words, that [the Goſpel in it ſelf conſidered, is wanting in that honour aſſigned to an inſtrument, to have influx to the producing of the effect of the principal cauſe, by a proper cauſality. If none dare ſay, that faith hath ſuch an influx, they may much leſſe ſay, that the Word hath ſuch.] This in very big terms is denyed, and the oppoſite boldly aſſerted. <hi>The Goſpel,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in it ſelf conſidered without the co-ordinate, or ſubordinate, or ſuperior cauſality of faith, hath this honour ſo fully, clearly, beyond all doubt, that no man that is a preacher of this Gospel ſhould queſtion it.</hi> When I ſtand thus highly charged, to deny that which no Preacher of the Goſpel ſhould queſtion, by reaſon of the clear evidence of it, every man may juſtly expect full, clear, and evident Scriptures, and reaſons, beyond all doubt, for my conviction; but I hear of neither; but inſtead of it, firſt, a piece of a Conceſſion; Secondly, a Simile. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion is, <hi>That the Gospel, without the concomitance of faith doth not actually juſtifie, elſe faith were no condition, or cauſa ſine qua
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:168215:249"/> non.</hi> That faith ſhould barely wait, effecting nothing, and gain no further honour then here is aſſigned, will appear a ſtrange aſſertion. If it had its efficacy where it was in being in miraculous cures, ſo that it was ſaid, <hi>Thy faith hath made thee whole;</hi> I think it is much rather efficacious in juſtification, there being ſo much ſpoken of juſtification <hi>by faith.</hi> I deſire Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to conſider the words of his learned dying friend Mr. <hi>Gata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> in his letter to him. <hi>And ſurely faith as a medium, ſeems to have a more peculiar office in the tranſaction of that main buſineſſe of Juſtification, then either repentance, or any other grace, as the love, or fear of God, and the like. Which to me, ſeems the more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, becauſe I find it ſo oft ſaid in the Word, that men are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith, but no where by repentance: Albeit, that alſo be as a condition thereunto required as alſo that form of ſpeech,</hi> 
                              <gap reason="foreign">

There followes a Simile as full of obſcurity, as the earth is of darkneſſe, and it were aeſie ſo far as it is intelligible, to make it appear, how much it halteth; but that I will not trouble the Reader with ſuch impertinencies, and I look for proofs, rather then Similes; and here is no proof at all.</p>
                           <p>I further infer in my Treatiſe, [Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> therefore affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word to be an inſtrument of Gods Spirit, preſently addes, Now inſtruments are either cooperative, or paſſive, and the Word muſt be one of theſe two. <hi>Cooperative,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>it is not;</hi> and gives his reaſon; <hi>It is therefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a paſſive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument working onely per modum objecti, as it containes a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Divine will, and it propoſeth to the underſtanding and will the things to be known, believed, and practiſed.</hi>] Here many exceptions are taken.</p>

                           </p>
                           <p>Fourthly, <hi>That this paſſive inſtrumentality of the Word in ſanctifying, doth very ill agree with the language of Scripture, which makes the Word to be mighty, powerful, pulling down ſtrong-holds,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>Fifthly, That <hi>Mr. Pemble herein is ſingle and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>To ſpeak to theſe in order. To the firſt I ſay. Though Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> gives an inſtance of the Words work in ſanctification, yet there is no reaſon to believe, that he limits his whole diſcourſe to it, indefinitely affirming that it is a paſſive inſtrument, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving inſtance in one, there is no imaginable reaſon that he can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the other. For his ſecond; He lets his Reader know, that he took an haſty view of Mr. <hi>Pemble,</hi> when he ſaid, that <hi>this was all his reaſon,</hi> he may ſee the thing fully argued by him, <hi>mihi,</hi> pag. 97, 98, 99, &amp;c <hi>in quarto,</hi> which is too long to tranſcribe. The work which is done upon the ſoul is wrought by the Spirit, as the principal agent, whether it be to regeneration, progreſſive ſanctification, or in order to juſtification; every previous work in tendency towards theſe, is from the Spirit likewiſe, as illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, conviction; the beginning and whole progreſſe is by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The Word is no more then an inſtrument, and all that the Word doth, is by power from the Spirit, and therefore ſaid to be mighty <hi>through God,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.5. Now the Spirit muſt work by way of power, either on the Word, or the ſoul as its object; It muſt infuſe power and ſtrength into the one as the principal agent in the work, Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> denies, that it works thus by an infuſion of power into the Word, and affirmes that the infuſion of ſtrength is into the ſoul, and not into the Word, which the Apoſtle confirmes, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.16. As for his third, which he ſaies, he will undertake to declare, he brings nothing but bare authorities; He faith, <hi>he hath read many that ſay one thing, and ſome that ſay another, but himſelf is of</hi> Scotus <hi>his mind,</hi> and we have not one ſyllable to induce any other to be of the ſame judgement. His fourth, Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> anſwers, and ſaith, That, <hi>all thoſe phraſes there reckoned up are to be underſtood by a
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:168215:250"/> metonymy, which though they properly belong to the inviſible power of the Holy Ghoſt, giving effect unto his own Word, yet are figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively attributed unto the Word it ſelf, which he uſeth as his viſible inſtrument,</hi> explaining himſelf by ſeveral ſimilitudes. For his laſt, If Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> be thus ſole and ſingular, he was much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken; Having fully ſpoke his judgement in this thing, he addes, pag. 99. <hi>And this is the ſentence of the Orthodox Church touching the nature and diſtinction of theſe two callings, Inward by the work of the Spirit, outward by the voice of the Word. The Arminians are of another opinion, whoſe judgement</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>about this matter is thus, &amp;c.</hi> At large laying down their doctrine. And it were eaſy to multiply thoſe teſtimonies that take all efficacy or energy from the Word, to give it to the Spirit, uſually quoting 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6, 7. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5. He tells me, <hi>I doubt whether you believe him or your ſelf throughly; for if you did, I think you would preach but coldly. I am perſwaded you look your preaching ſhould operate actively.</hi> And does he think Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> did believe his own doctrine, or was he a cold Preacher? he delivers his doctrine with confidence, and backes it with reaſons; and the workes that he hath left behind, argue that he ſpake with ſome heat, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; and I wiſh that I could gain more heat both in prayer and preaching, and I do look that my preaching ſhould operate active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but whether of it ſelf, or through the power of the Spirit, there lyes the queſtion. He concludes, <hi>If it were proved that there were an hundred paſſive inſtruments, it would never be proved that faith is one (as an inſtrument doth ſignifie an efficient cauſe) of Gods work of juſtifying us, neither really, nor reputatively, is it ſuch.</hi> To which I ſay I read in Divines of a juſtification active, and that is the work of God, and a juſtification paſſive, of which man is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; as I read of a double miraculous faith, one active, to work a cure; the other paſſive, to be cured. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw that the Cripple at <hi>Lyſtra</hi> had faith to be healed, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.9. Yet I ſuppoſe that this is called a paſſive faith; not that it acted not at all, (which is contradicted by Chriſt, in ſaying, <hi>Thy faith hath made thee whole</hi>) but that it ſerved for a paſſive work on the diſeaſed; ſo I think this faith which tends to our juſtification, is not meerly paſſive, though it ſerves for ſuch a work as receives that denomination. When I receive a gift that enriches, I act; Yet he that gives, onely does enrich, and I that receive, am enriched; ſo it is in juſtification, we do not juſtifie, but are juſtified, and yet act in
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:168215:250"/> receiving Chriſt for juſtification, as ſick ones in Chriſts tyme, did not heal, but were healed, yet their faith acted for cure and ours for juſtification. I confeſſe I did ſomewhat needleſſely runne upon this diſcourſe of paſſive inſtruments, upon occaſion of Mr. <hi>Pembles</hi> words, and Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> denyal that there was any ſuch thing as a paſſive inſtrument, never intending to make faith meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſive; which was never my opinion, neither am I altogether without ſcruple in that which Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> delivers; yet I would have thoſe that are confidently oppoſite, to weigh the ſtreng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

My error is detected, and I am ſent where I may underſtand my ſelf better. <hi>You ſeem to think that the Covenant juſtifies by ſome real operation on the ſoul, as the Papiſts ſay, and our Divines ſay, it ſanctifies, or as it doth juſtifie in</hi> foro Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiae, <hi>by giving aſſurance, and comfort; but Sir,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I opened my thoughts fully in Aphoriſ. pag.</hi> 173, 174, &amp;c. <hi>I ſcarce beſtowed ſo many words on any one particular point.</hi> But I marvel that it ſhould be expected, that my new learning ſhould be bottomed on his doctrine there delivered, ſeeing himſelf there ſpeaks with ſo much vacillancy,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> former vacil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation in this doctrine.</note> pag. 176. <hi>I dare not be too confident in ſo dark a point, but it ſeemeth to me that this juſtifying, tranſient act, is the enacting or promulgation of the new Covenant wherein juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is conferred upon every believer;</hi> and in the cloſe of all, when he hath ſpoke his full mind, he addes, pag. 180. <hi>This is the preſent apprehenſion I have of the nature of remiſſion, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;</hi> adding, <hi>Si quid noviſti rectigus, &amp;c.</hi> But now he peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily ſayes, <hi>I ſpeak not of the effect of Gods Word as preached to mens heart, but as it is (lex promulgata, &amp; foedus, &amp; teſtamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum) and ſo doth convey right, or conſtitute the dueneſſe of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.11, 12. I would learn of my Catechriſt that is now thus raiſed out of douhtings, in this manner, to take the chair.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Whether this enacting or promulgation of the new Covenant, (which is the tranſient act, in which juſtification is conferred on every believer) find men in the faith upon the promulgation of it? If ſo, then actual faith ptecedes any knowledge of the Covenant; if not, whether he preſuppoſeth, that men upon the Lawes promulgation, will believe of themſelves without any further work? or whether God makes uſe of any other inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the work of faith? If theſe be anſwered in the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:168215:251"/> that men will not believe of themſelves upon ſuch promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, nor there is any other like inſtrument for this work, then I think it muſt follow, that God makes uſe of this Covenant thus enacted to work men to believe, and ſo I am further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in my former ſuppoſed miſtake, that the Covenant works by a real operation on the ſoul in order to juſtification; Namely, By working men out of unbelief into faith. I had thought that when <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Appollos</hi> are Miniſters <hi>by whom men believe;</hi> that they had by the means of this encted, or promulgated Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, brought men to this poſture. And though juſtification be a relative change, and not a real, as is truly affirmed, yet that a real change had been wrought in the ſoul for this work. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he ſaies, <hi>He ſpeaks not of the effect of Gods Word, as preached to mens hearts, but, &amp;c.</hi> I think he ought to ſpeak ſo of it, when he ſpeaks of it as an inſtrument of juſtification. In his ſenſe, I ſuppoſe it can be no inſtrument of juſtification; an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument muſt ſerve to work the thing of which it is an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but in this caſe, juſtification is before-hand wrought; and therefore, according to the proverb, it cannot do that which is done before it comes: for the truth of this, let Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſpeak; <hi>The accepting Chriſt in this Covenant, is true juſtifying faith, if an unregenerate man have this indeed, then he is justfied,</hi> pag. 66. A believing man hath this indeed, and ſo is indeed juſtified, and the grant of the Covenant, is an inſtrument for juſtification of a juſtified perſon; I am demanded, <hi>Do you not often read in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of juſtificatio juris, vel legis, as diſtinct from juſtificatio ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis, vel per ſententiam?</hi> And I demand, whether of theſe juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications do procede? If <hi>juſtificatio juris</hi> go not before <hi>juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio Judicis,</hi> then the Judge juſtifies him whom the Law juſtifies not; In caſe it follow after, then it is onely a manifeſtation, or declaration of it, of which we may have further occaſion to ſpeak hereafter. And this conſidered, it appears to me that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſpeaks ef the Covenant onely as eyed of God, and not applyed to us, and then indeed it is no inſtrument of God, whereby he juſtifies, but his rule according to which he juſtifies. Pardon of ſin is a relative change, yet Miniſters appointed of Jeſus Chriſt for the pardon of ſin, are inſtrumental in working a real change from unbelief to faith in order to this work, and ſo are inſtruments of pardon <hi>diſpoſitivè,</hi> as <hi>Maſon de Miniſterio Anglicano</hi> ſpeaks, as well as <hi>declarativè.</hi>

It followes, <hi>If our faith give efficacy and power to the Goſpel to juſtifie us, then we juſtifie our ſelves, when the Goſpel juſtifies us, then the Goſpel is our inſtrument of juſtification; and can this be, unleſſe it be alſo ſaid, that we made the Goſpel? then God and we are concauſes in the Goſpels act of donation.</hi> But how this can follow, I think few but himſelf can ſee: It will onely follow that the Goſpel cannot juſtifie us without us, that which <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath <hi>de verbis Apoſtoli,</hi> Ser. 15. will follow, <hi>He that made thee without thee, doth not juſtifie thee without thee.</hi> It will follow, that ſomewhat is to be done by us, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of which the Goſpel for juſtification is inefficacious;<note place="margin">Qui ergo fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit te ſine te, non juſtificat te ſine te.</note> and how the ſecond can follow, that the Goſpel is our inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of juſtification, I deſire to know: If <hi>Naamans</hi> dipping himſelf ſeven times in <hi>Jordan,</hi> rendred it by Divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment efficacious for cure of his Leproſie, will it follow, that <hi>Jordan</hi> was his inſtrument, whereby he cured himſelf? If the Angels moving on the water, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. gave efficacy for cure to him that firſt entred, will it then follow, that it was either the Angels, or his inſtrument that firſt entred, and not rather the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of God onely? And to his queſtion moved, <hi>Can this be, unleſſe we made the Goſpel?</hi> If we ſhould grant that it is our inſtrument, will this follow? Can no man uſe an inſtrument unleſſe he firſt made it? <hi>Peter</hi> it ſeems was no <hi>fiſher,</hi> but rather
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:168215:252"/> a <hi>Cutler,</hi> and made the ſword wherewith he cut off <hi>Malchus</hi> ear, or elſe he could not have uſed it as his inſtrument. Neither followes it, that God and we are concauſes; It would onely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that there is a willing concurrence in us to accept of that which God of grace doth give. That of <hi>Auſtin</hi> will follow, which immediately is added in the place quoted,<note place="margin">Ergo fecit neſcientem, juſtificat vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentem, tamen ipſe juſtificat, ne ſit juſtitia tua.</note> 
                              <hi>He therefore that made thee unwilling, doth not juſtifie thee unwilling; yet he doth juſtifie thee, leſt it ſhould be thine own righteouſneſſe.</hi> It will then follow, that in ſelf-denyal, renouncing all ſelf-righteouſneſſe, we humbly accept what God of grace doth give.

As it tenders conditions, ſo it is employed to work the conditions that it tenders: It makes known the mind of God, that men believing have right to Chriſt, and in him to juſtification, and it works faith for juſtification, onely believers ſaved by it, and it is the power of God, and not <hi>nudè ſignùm vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatis divinae,</hi> to ſalvation. And as the Simile brought by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> of a <hi>Fathers bequeathing by his teſtament an hundred pound a peece to each of his ſons; To one on condition he will aske it of his elder Brother, and thanke him for it; to a ſecond, and third upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions at pleaſure,</hi> with this demand upon it, <hi>Do any of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions give power to the teſtament? No, yet the teſtament doth not efficaciter agere, till they are performed, why is that?</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all ſuch inſtruments work morally; onely by expreſſing ut ſigna the will of the agent; and therefore they work both when and how he will, and it is his will that they ſhall not work till ſuch a time, and but upon ſuch termes, &amp;c.</hi> He might eaſily ſee how little
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:168215:254"/> this ſerves to our preſent purpoſe. 1. That which he ſpeaks of, is a bare teſtament, and no more; but the Goſpel (as elſewhere I have ſhewed) is a Covenant truly ſo called, and not barely a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. 2. Thoſe Legacies are ſuch gifts that each ſon would be apt to imbrace, being ready to put a ſufficiently high eſtimate upon them; But this Goſpel-gift, if nothing further be done, will for ever lye contemned, and neglected. 3. The will is a meer inſtrument of donation, leaving the Legatee to himſelf; to accept or refuſe. The Goſpel is the inſtrument of Gods power by the Spirit, to change the heart, and work upon the will for acceptance. 4. Theſe teſtament-legacies preſuppoſe the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not yet performed, and ſo the Legatee without all right up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Teſtament-termes; But Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Goſpel-donation, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the conditions already done, and the ſoul upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in full poſſeſſion, before this Goſpel-donation comes; It conveyes right to a believer, and if he be a believer, as hath been abundantly ſhewed, he is in preſent poſſeſt of Chriſt his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and juſtification by him. And whether or no, I have acquit my ſelf from the double charge, brought againſt me, I ſhall leave to the Readers conſideration.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. If there be an inſtrumental efficiency aſcribed to faith in Scripture in a work, in which there is as much of God, and as little of man ſeen as in the work of juſtification, then there is no reaſon but that faith alſo hath an inſtrumental efficacy in the work of juſtification. This is clear; The reaſon given why faith ſhould have no inſtrumental efficacy, is, becauſe this takes from God, who alone is the efficient, and aſcribes to man, who is juſtified, and doth not juſtifie himſelf: But an inſtrumental effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency is aſcribed in Scripture to faith, in a work on which there is as much of God, and as little of man, as in the work of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. This is clear, in miraculous cures wrought upon diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed perſons: The work upon them was Gods, not mans; They were cured, and did not cure themſelves, yet an inſtrumentall efficiency is aſcribed to their faith. If thoſe words ſpoke to the two blind men, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.29. <hi>According to your faith, be it unto you,</hi> nor that of <hi>Paul,</hi> concerning the creeple at <hi>Lyſtra, That he had faith to be healed,</hi> Act. 14.9. nor yet that of Chriſt to the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitiſh</hi> woman, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.28. <hi>O woman, great is thy faith, be it unto thee as thou wilt,</hi> will not hold it out, which yet ſeem to ſpeak very much this way; (other graces were qualifications, yet none
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:168215:255"/> but this is taken notice of) yet that to the woman with the bloody iſſue is full, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.22. <hi>Mark.</hi> 5.34. <hi>Thy faith hath made thee whole,</hi> not onely made whole by faith (which is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception againſt faiths juſtifying) but faith made her whole,<note place="margin">Quemadmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum fidei aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribit Chriſtus quod mulier ſoluta eſt à morbo corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, ita certum eſt fide nos conſequi re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionem pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorum &amp; adoptionem fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorum Dei juxta doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelii.</note> words ſpeaking as much of inſtrumental efficacy as may be. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion then followes, That faith hath its inſtrumental efficiency in juſtification likewiſe. <hi>Pareus</hi> his notes upon the words are worthy obſervation. <hi>As Chriſt aſcribes it to faith, that the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is healed of the diſeaſe of her body: ſo it is certain, that by faith we obtain remiſſion of ſins, and adoption of children of God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the doctrine of the Goſpel.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">2. If there be an inſtrumental efficiency aſcribed to faith in Scripture reſpective to ſalvation: then there is an inſtrumental efficacy aſcribed to faith, reſpective to juſtification. This is plain; nothing can inſtrumentally work to ſalvation, that takes not in juſtification. But an inſtrumental efficacy is aſcribed to faith, reſpective to ſalvation, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.59. <hi>He ſaid to the woman, Thy faith hath ſaved thee.</hi> In the context there is a full proof of the <hi>Major.</hi> The great priviledge which ſhe of grace received there is the forgiveneſſe of her many ſins, and this is acribed to her faith. The <hi>Minor</hi> is fully proved; Her great love is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as a conſequent of this grace received; But it is aſcribed to her faith, as that which had its alone efficacy, <hi>Thy faith hath ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thee.</hi> As we are ſaved by faith, or through faith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8. ſo faith ſaves. The concluſion then followes, that faith hath its inſtrumental efficacy in juſtification.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. That which puts a man into poſſeſſion of that from which juſtification neceſſarily and inevitably followes, that is either a principal efficient, or an inſtrument in juſtification. This cannot be denyed: He that puts me into a place, to which a plentiful livelihood is neceſſarily annexed, is either the efficient or an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of my livelihood: But faith puts into poſſeſſion of Chriſt, from whom juſtification neceſſarily followes. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition conſiſts of two parts. 1. That faith puts into poſſeſſion of Chriſt. 2. That juſtification neceſſarily followes this poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But I ſhall ſtand upon the proof of neither, ſeeing as in themſelves they are plain, ſo they are confeſſed by Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi> Faith then is either the efficient or inſtrument in our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Not the efficient, all know, and therefore an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                           <p n="4">
                              <pb n="487" facs="tcp:168215:255"/>4. That which is aſcribed in Scripture both to God and man, in a work, in which there is a concurrence of God and man, in ſuch expreſſions, which uſually hold forth the efficiency of an inſtrument, and cannot fairly be interpreted otherwiſe, is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly called an inſtrument both of God and man in ſuch a work. This I know not how fairly can be denyed; and any man will but abuſe his reaſon that calls for a proof of it: But faith in Scripture is aſcribed both to God and man in the work of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, in which there is a mutual concurrence of God and man, and in words that uſually hold out the working of an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and cannot fairly be interpreted otherwiſe: Therefore faith is not unfitly called the inſtrument of God, and man in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification. The Minor conſiſts of four parts. 1. That faith in juſtification is aſcribed both to God and man, and this conſiſts alſo of two parts. 1. That faith is aſcribed to God in juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and this we have already proved from, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.30. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. as it is alſo aſcribed to him in ſanctification, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.9. 2. That it is aſcribed to man in juſtification which is held out to us whereſoever we are ſaid to be juſtified by faith, ſeeing faith is the act of man: and the Prophet tells us, <hi>The just ſhall live by his faith,</hi> which the Apoſtle applyes to juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.11. The ſecond part in this Propoſition is, That there is a mutual concurrence of God and man in this work, as God gives a diſcharge, ſo man accepts: Which by Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> himſelf is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, according to that before quoted out of <hi>Auſtin.</hi> The third part is, That th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap> is aſcribed to God and man in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions that uſually hold forth the efficiency of an inſtrument, which the phraſes [by] and [through] do manifeſt. The fourth is, That it cannot be fairly interpreted otherwiſe, or of any other thing but an inſtrument. And this is alſo clear, Either it muſt hold out a meritorious cauſe, a meer condition, or elſe an inſtrument. A meritorious cauſe none will ſay, a meer condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or bare <hi>cauſa ſine quâ non,</hi> it cannot be, for two reaſons. 1. Such phraſes are uncouth, to ſay, That a thing is done by that which is meerly a condition <hi>ſine quâ non</hi> of it. 2. There are many other ſuch conditions, to which this is never thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>To which of the Angels ſaid he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he ſhall be to me a Sonne?</hi> Heb. 1.5. <hi>To which of the Angels ſaid he at any time, Sit on my right hand, untill
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:168215:256"/> I make thine enemies thy footſtoole?</hi> Heh. 1.13. ſo we may ſay, To which of the graces, (when all are reckoned up by number) was it ever ſaid, that we are juſtified, by it? Tthe concluſion then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes as before, that faith is an inſtrument of God and man in juſtification.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Out of this we may more briefly thus argue: If the holy Ghoſt ſingle out faith from among all other graces; which are yet conditions or <hi>cauſae ſine quibus non,</hi> and aſcribes alone to it that which in the ordinary acceptation holds out an inſtrumental efficiency, then it is not a bare condition, or <hi>cauſa ſine quâ non,</hi> but an inſtrumental efficient: But the holy Ghoſt ſingles out faith from among all other graces which are conditions and <hi>cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſae ſine quibus non,</hi> and aſcribes to it and no other, that which in the ordinary acceptation implies an i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>ſtrumental efficiency; The concluſion then followes, that faith is an inſtrumental efficient in juſtification.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, To bring if it may be a compromizing argument, If faith works at leaſt, that which is proportionable to an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment properly and rigidly ſo called in the work of juſtification, then it is not unfitly called by the name of an inſtrument. This is plain; that which does work, that every way anſwers to the work of an inſtrument, that may fitly be called by that name; But faith works at leaſt, that which is proportionable to the work of an inſtrument. This is confeſt by Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> who is ready to yield that it ſhould be called, <hi>Instrumentum Metaphoricum,</hi> and a Metaphor is a figure whereby a word is carried out of its moſt proper ſignification, unto an other that carries reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance and proportion with it. In caſe then it does not that whch is proportionable to an inſtrument properly ſo called, it is no <hi>inſtrumentum Metaphporicum, but Catachreſticon.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> gloſſe renders it ſuch a <hi>Catachreſis,</hi> as may make all Rhetorique aſhamed of it. A Metaphoricall Inſtrument that ſhall have no reſemblance of an inſtrument in it; But if any will ſay that an inſtrument is externall, ſenſible, whether it be for operation or reception; but faith is internall, inviſible; and therefore no inſtrument rigidly and properly ſo called, though there be no cogent reaſon to yield it, (for as is the agent, ſo well may be the inſtrument), yet I ſhall not be ſo ſtiff to contend about it; yield that it doth the work to put into Chriſt from whom Juſtification neceſſarily followes, and I will no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:168215:256"/> about the Word, but let it be an inſtrument in exact proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſpeech or in a Metaphor as men ſhall pleaſe.</p>
                           <p>As to that of the ſole ſufficiency of the Word, without faith, as an inſtrument in Juſtification; I might take up an argument from Mr. <hi>Baxters,</hi> and thus reaſon: That which cannot bring a man to the works that are antecedent to juſtification, cannot juſtify: This is clear; That which cannot work the prerequiſites, cannot work the thing it ſelf: But the Word alone (according to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>) cannot bring a man to theſe antecedent works, Sect. 14. Chap. 29. <hi>Ergo.</hi> But I ſhall content my ſelf at preſent with this onely. That which the Word ſaies, is done by faith, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do without it; This is clear: But the Word ſaies, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſaies, we are juſtified by faith: <hi>Ergo</hi> the Word cannot juſtify without faith. Here ſome diſtinction muſt be uſed, if any evaſion be endeavored; But then it muſt be confeſſed, that it is an other kind of juſtification that is ſpoke to by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> then is laid down in Scripture: For Scripture-juſtification is ſtill by faith: that is the Holy Ghoſts conſtant language. And to come to a right underſtanding (if it may be) of parties; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what muſt be yielded, and ſomewhat aſſerted, and maintained. That which muſt be yielded is, That God in his Word declares upon what terms a man may attain unto juſtification; and to this the Word, as <hi>ſignum voluntatis divinae</hi> (being a manifeſtation of Gods pleaſure concerning the juſtification of a ſinner) is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; So farre I ſhall willingly grant. That which is to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted is, 1. That this manifeſtation of Gods pleaſure, or <hi>ſignum voluntatis divinae</hi> before mentioned, is the firſt ground work on which the whole work of juſtification is bottomed, and goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe graces but now mentioned, which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> makes antecedent to juſtification. This is plain. The termes on which God will juſtifie muſt be underſtood, before men can be brought to accept and come up to them. 2. This manifeſtation of Gods will thus made knowne, and by the power of the Spirit applyed to the ſoul, in an unjuſtified condition, works to humiliation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, faith, and by faith to juſtification. 3. This mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of Gods pleaſure being applyed to a man already hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, regenerate and in faith, finds him as we have heard before in a juſtified poſture. Though Faith in nature goes before juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as the cauſe before the effect; yet they are in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>ſimul tempore;</hi> that none can conceive a believing man in an
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:168215:257"/> unjuſtified condition: that ſo there ſhould any intervall or time paſſe, for conveyance of right by Goſpel-grant to juſtification. 4. This Goſpel-grant or manifeſtation of Gods mind being thus tendred as before,; to a regenerate believing ſoul, ſerves for ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification and confirmation of his juſtified condition, to make good to ſuch a believing ſon or daughter, that their ſinnes are forgiven. To apply theſe aſſertions to our preſent purpoſe. This manifeſtation of Gods pleaſure, Goſpel-grant, or <hi>ſignum voluntatis divinae,</hi> or whatſoever elſe we call it, in the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration juſtifies not; Going before that which is antecedent to Juſtification (as we ſee it does) it cannot juſtify. In the ſecond conſideration it works indeed to juſtification; But if we yield this to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> he will not accept of it; for he ſaies, he does not thus ſpeak of it; and in this conſideration it juſtifies not without faith, but works faith in order to Juſtification. <hi>By this man is preached forgiveneſſe of ſins, and by him all that believe are juſtified.</hi> In the third conſideration it juſtifies not, ſeeing it finds the work done to its hands, and onely ſerves for the work of aſſurance as in the laſt place is aſſerted. So that, all that can be ſaid of this Goſpel-grant, donation, or conveyance of right (ſo often by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> mentioned in this work) is, 1. To make known Gods mind, on what termes juſtification may be attained. 2 By the power of the Spirit through faith to work it, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to aſſure, ratify, and confirm it. I ſhall the refore cloſe this diſpute (if I may be allowed ſo to ſtile it) in the words of <hi>Chem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitius</hi> in his Common place, de juſtificat, <hi>mihi</hi> pag. 797. <hi>octavo.</hi> Having ſpoken to the cauſes of juſtification he ſaith, <hi>It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together neceſſary that there be application made of theſe cauſes to the perſon to be juſtified.</hi>

                        <p>AS Chriſtians muſt ſee that they be aright principled in this Goſpel-doctrine of the righteouſneſſe of faith,<note place="margin">Chriſtians muſt get aſſurance that they do act according to theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</note> ſo alſo they muſt get aſſurance that they act according to theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which I might urge reſpective to all that, which is required of a man of Goſpel-righteouſneſſe. But having already ſpoke to that purpoſe in preſſing the neceſſity of the anſwer of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience unto Sacramental engagements; I ſhall here onely urge it, reſpectively to that grace which immediately intereſts us in this righteouſneſſe, which is the grace of faith, as we ſee in the Text; which is confeſt to be the grace that receives Chriſt, even by thoſe that deny the inſtrumentality of it in our Juſtification. If this righteouſneſſe which is our Juſtification be the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Faith, then thoſe that are void of faith muſt needs be wanting in this righteouſneſſe, and Chriſt being the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe to thoſe that believe, thoſe that perſiſt in unbelief never attain to this end. And howſoever zealous they may otherwiſe appear, yet they come ſhort of righteouſneſſe for life and ſalvation. Giving aſſent to all Goſpel-truths, (perhaps upon the principles of their education) they may not onely have the repute, but alſo enjoy all outward priviledges of believers; yet wanting that work upon their will, or if you pleaſe in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to receive Chriſt and cloſe with him, they yet have not
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:168215:258"/> Chriſt nor life in him, and therefore upon this account, there is all reaſon to hearken to that of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Eſpecially to ſee to their faith.</note> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine your ſelves, whether ye be in the faith: prove your own ſelves: Know ye not your own ſelves, how that Jeſus Christ is in you, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye be Reprobates?</hi> In which words we ſee the Apoſtles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, and his reaſon annext.

The reaſon annexed is put by way of interrogation, or queſtion, <hi>Know ye not your own ſelves, how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye be reprobates?</hi> which doth not imply, that all are Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, that know not in preſent, that Chriſt is in them; but this is all that is implyed or can be gathered, that Jeſus Chriſt is in all that are not reprobates; where reprobate is not yet oppoſed to the Elect, as though all ſuch were everlaſtingly caſt-awayes in whom Chriſt is not in preſent: But as the word is uſed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.30. reprobate ſilver, that is, unfit for uſe or ſervice, ſo it is here taken: ſuch in preſent are not in a ſaving, but in a loſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and therefore it much concerns us to put this upon the tryal.</p>

Chriſt is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Store-houſe, Magazine, or rich Exchequer; The Father hath not a gift for any of his, but he layes it up in Chriſt, and a faith receives it from Chriſt. <hi>Noah</hi> by faith was <hi>heir of this righteouſneſſe,</hi> Heb. 11.7. The reſt of the world wanting this grace went without this inheritance. The reſt of <hi>Canaan</hi> was loſt by unbelief, Heb. 3.18. The reſt of heaven will be thus loſt in like manner, <hi>God hath choſen the poor of this world, rich in
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:168215:258"/> faith, heires of the Kingdome, which he hath prepared for thoſe that love him,</hi> Jam. 2.5. The rich of this world deſtitute of this Faith, make forfeiture of this Kingdome. Is Chriſt a gift? Faith receives him, and unbelief is wanting. Is Chriſt food? Faith feeds upon him, and unbelief is hunger-ſtarved. Is Chriſt rayment? Faith puts him on, and unbelief is naked. Is Chriſt a Medicine? Faith applyes him, and unbelief languiſheth. Is Chriſt a laver? Faith drencheth and douzeth it ſelf in him, and unbelief is filthy, and defiled. Is Chriſt a pardon? Faith ſues it out, and unbelief lyeth under guilt. Is Chriſt ſatisfaction? Faith makes the plea, and attains a diſcharge, and unbelief re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains indebted. 2. Without Faith, the ſoul is under the wrath of God and his ireful diſpleaſure. This is a neceſſary reſult from the former. The man of unbelief wants that which might be interpoſed as an atonement, and might ſtand as a skreen or ſhield for his guard. And it is alſo fully laid down in Chriſt's words, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36. <hi>He that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life: but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> What <hi>Zophar</hi> ſaith of the wicked man, <hi>Job</hi> 20.29. <hi>This is his portion from God, and the heritage appointed him of God,</hi> that Chriſt ſayes of unbelievers: ſo long as they remain in unbelief, ſo long wrath abides on them. All by nature are the children of wrath, having no other inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and the man of unbelief never gets from under wrath to attain any other portion. This is an aggregate of all miſeries, when all is reckoned up that can be named, to make miſerable, wrath comprizeth it all to the uttermoſt, to infiniteneſſe. <hi>As is the man, ſo is his ſtrength,</hi> ſay <hi>Zeba,</hi> and <hi>Zalmunna,</hi> Judg. 8.21. As is God, ſo is his wrath; with this motive the Pſalmiſt preſſeth to faith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.12. Thy ſin hath merit enough to damne, and thou haſt not any intereſt in Chriſt to ſave or deliver. He that is void of Faith, and yet under no ſuch feares, it is not becauſe there is no cauſe of feares, but that ſuch a ſoul is not awakened, to ſee his fearful deplored and deſperate condition. If the rich glutton had ſeen Hell gaping for him, and the Devil ready to hale and drag him, he could not then have had any liſt to his every-dayes Gorgeous apparrel, nor yet any appetite to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate fare. That is the condition of ſecure ſenſual ones, till Hell-fire flame about them, they think they are ſure of heaven. 3. Without faith there is no benefit to be had, or good to be found in any Ordinances. No Ordinance is uſeful but either as
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:168215:259"/> it is improved by Faith already ſeated in the ſoul, or as it is ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the plantation of it. No duty of any kind works to acceptance from an unbelievers hand. <hi>Abel's</hi> ſacrifice was accepted, when <hi>Cain's</hi> could not gain acceptance, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.4, 5. The Apoſtle ſhews us the reaſon of this difference, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4. <hi>By faith Abel offered a more excellent ſacrifice then Cain.</hi> The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the ſower tells us, how few profitable hearers of the Word there can be found; and the Apoſtle gives the reaſon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. <hi>The Word is not mixt with faith in thoſe that hear it.</hi> It is effectual alone in believers, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. and no more have audience in prayer, then thoſe that profit in hearing: and there is one and the ſame reaſon of both, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.6, 7. And that man is doubtleſſe under an heavy Judgment, that never gets good when he hears from God, nor obtains his requeſt when he ſeeks to God. At the Lords Table they eat bread, but feed not on Chriſt; they take the Cup, but have no intereſt in the blood of the new Covenant. 4. Without faith nothing is done that God accepts. The man and the work both diſpleaſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. There muſt be a concurrence of all requiſites to render a work good, and acceptable: But in an unbelievers work (the matter of the work excepted) all requiſites are wanting. The riſe is from a fountain that is unclean, and the unbelieving ſoul cannot go ſo high as to make the glory of God the end. And the rule is above him in the work to look after. 5. Without Faith the whole of man, head, breaſt, and bowels, are all open to Satan. Faith is a Chriſtians ſhield, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.16. and a ſhield is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence not of one part, but the guard of the whole. A man without faith, is a Souldier without armes, and deſtitute of all power to make any manner of reſiſtance. Satan leads ſuch an one at pleaſure. There is nothing of Chriſt, nothing of grace, nothing of the Spirit, to ſtand up in oppoſition. Some devils are not reſiſted without ſtrength of faith, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.29. No devil without faith can be vanquiſhed or overcome.</p>

The heart rent, torn, broken, and nothing in its own eyes is the proper ſeat of it. You may as ſoon find a fair rich garden, or a fruitful corn-field upon an hard rock, or in ground where no plough hath toucht, as you can find faith in an heart not caſt down, but lift up in it ſelf. This we may ſee in the oppoſition put by the Prophet, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. <hi>His ſoul which is lifted up is not upright in him, but the juſt ſhall live by his faith.</hi> The heart is ſometimes ſaid to be lift up for God, high in reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions and actings in his obedience, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.6. This is not done, but by the ſtrength of faith. The unbelieving ſoul in the wayes of heaven is low, and daſtardly; but the lift-up heart in this place of the Prophet, is an heart high in it ſelf, never yet brought down to the ſight of its own defiled and deplored con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and this is put in oppoſition to the believing heart. This ſoul little heeds a threat, as little regards a promiſe, ſees no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of reliance upon Chriſt, and hath no ſtrength for obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. The oppoſite to this is the believing ſoul, and that is the humbled ſoul, brought down in ſenſe and ſight of its own
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:168215:261"/> condition. Humiliation, as the word bears, is a bringing down, laying low, and rendring baſe and contemptible, and this is the moſt proper acceptation, and in Scripture variouſly uſed; 1. As the act of God upon man, or any ſociety of men, as, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.2, 3. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.7. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.21. 2. The act of man upon man, one man upon another; and this, either to make ſinfully vile, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily low; ſo the defiling of a woman is called humbling her, <hi>Levit.</hi> 21.14. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.10, 11. or to make outwardly low and mean; ſo <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> took an oath of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> and brought him under homage, <hi>to make the Kingdome baſe,</hi> Ezek. 17.14. 3. As the act of man upon himſelf, and this alſo either to make ſinfully vile, as the ſons of <hi>Eli made themſelves vile,</hi> 1 Sam. 3.13. or outwardly vile, and ſo the Lord Chriſt for our ſakes <hi>humbled himſelf,</hi> Phil. 2.8. And as the word is uſed to make low, or render vile, ſo alſo to eſteem, repute and account as low, and vile: Sin brings a man lower then the dunghill, then the dungeon, and man hath made himſelf ſo by ſin. When we ſee our ſelves in this low eſtate, and are brought to a ſenſe and acknowledgment of it, then we are humble, then we humble our ſelves; and the ſoul that is brought into this frame, is the ſoyl in which faith takes, and kindly growes. Such a ſoul ſees nothing but want, and therefore is glad of ſupplyes: ſees nothing but danger, and therefore is glad of ſupport, and deliverance. As the lift-up heart will not come to Chriſt, that it may have life, being under no ſenſe of death, ſo theſe cannot be kept from Chriſt. The ſoul which is naturally high and lofty, is not in Gods ordinary way wrought into this frame without ſome ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible work upon it, being ſo foul, and yet in its own eyes clean; ſo wretched, and yet in its own thoughts happy; it muſt be brought to conviction in order to converſion; it muſt by the Law be brought to ſee ſin, before it will be waſht from it, or will ſeek a pardon of it. There muſt be <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> to make way for Chriſt, ſome ſoul-ſhakings, before the ſweet and ſtill voyce of Goſpel-comforts. Something indeed may be ſaid, as to thoſe, that with <hi>Timothy</hi> have been trained up from child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, in the knowledge of Scriptures, and with <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſanctified in the womb, for the abatement of this ſoul-humbling, and ſhaking work, as to the degree of it, though not to the total excluſion. They were not capable to make obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the pollution of ſin, till they were in their meaſure by
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:168215:262"/> the Spirit cleanſed, nor to know the danger of ſin, till they were juſtified and acquitted; yet even in thoſe, there is ſo much of the reliques of ſin, and remainders of corruption, that upon diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their inconformity in ſuch a meaſure to the will of God, they cannot want ſome workings of Spirit. But as to thoſe that live all their dayes, and never apprehend any thought of fear by reaſon of ſin, nor ever called the ſtate of their ſoul into queſtion, but have alwaies carried it in the ſame plight; Among all the queſtions that they have put in their lives, about their health, their eſtates, the nature of their grounds, or how to carry on their Trades (beſides thoſe multiplyed ones of meer vanity and inconſiderable concernment) they never had it in their thoughts to move a queſtion of any concernment to their ſoules. The young mans queſtion, the Jaylours queſtion, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> hearers queſtion, never came into their heads. I have ſeen little evidence of good in theſe; and I ſee little ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any thing of faith in their ſoules. You may ſpeak of ſome of theſe, as of men of good diſpoſitions, of a fair nature, and harmleſſe life and courſe; theſe may grow up in nature mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized and regulated, when yet faith is far from them: they may grow up high in profeſſion, but growing in the blade, or leaf onely, and not in the root, they may juſtly be ſuſpected. Every tree that bears a fair leaf, doth not bear good fruit; and every apple of a fair colour is not to be deſired for food. Such fruit as this, may take where faith will not grow. The Prophets words then ſhould be heeded, <hi>Break up your fallow ground, and ſowe not amongſt thornes:</hi> this way muſt be taken for ſoul-humbling, that men may be brought to believing.</p>

<pb n="501" facs="tcp:168215:262"/> is in that way required to the making up of faith, that is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten put for faith, as, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.11. And when God works to faith, he is ſaid to open the eyes, or to work to knowledge or light, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.32. <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. We come to faith by hearing, we muſt therefore hear, and know, before we can believe. Knowledge is the firſt act or work of the ſoul that conducerh towards faith in the heart; Now knowledge is threefold. Firſt, of ſenſe, we know what we ſee; <hi>Thomas</hi> knew Chriſt, that is the perſon of Chriſt, when he had ſeen his wounds, and put his finger into them. This knowledg is not neceſſarily required in faith, Chriſt there ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed is he that ſeeth not, and believeth,</hi> John 20.23. And the Apoſtle ſaith that faith <hi>is the evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> Secondly, of reaſon; we know thoſe things which our reaſon is able to reach; This knowledge runs through all ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in which we attain knowledge by diſcourſe; and the clearer head, the better Artiſt, and the more of knowledge. This we do not require to the being of faith, though faith be not alwaies againſt, yet it is oft above all our reaſonings; yea, our reaſonings, and hammering out concluſions are oftentimes againſt faith. The word of faith beats down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt the knowledg of God, and brings into captivity every thought, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. Our <hi>Notionaliſts</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed men of ſublimated underſtandings, in caſe they can alwaies reach unto that which according to the Goſpell they are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. Thirdly, of authority, we judge our ſelves to know a thing which men worthy of credit do make known: and if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the witneſſe of men, ſaith the Apoſtle, the witneſſe of God is greater, 1. <hi>John</hi> 5.9. The teſtimony of man gives a morall certainty; and ſuch that we will not queſtion. The multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of witneſſes renders our knowledge grounded on ſuch au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, more firm; and therefore the proverb, in a well qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſenſe, is at leaſt near to truth; <hi>Vox populi, vox Dei.

The te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of God is alwaies of infallible truth, as to the ſubſtance, ſo to every circumſtance of it: many paſſages about that maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre we may juſtly queſtion: ſo we muſt not any thing which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine verity hath made known. This knowledge we require in
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:168215:263"/> faith, and know it to be neceſſary to the being of faith; we muſt know that God hath revealed in his Word, a Trinity of Perſons, or elſe we ſhall believe no ſuch thing, as three diſtinct ſubſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in God, that the holy Ghoſt is God, that Chriſt is God, and man in one perſon, or elſe we ſhall believe no ſuch doctrine. We muſt know the creation, from the Scriptures, or elſe we ſhall not believe a creation, but run into that opinion, that all things have ever been, as they are. We muſt know the offices of Chriſt, or elſe we ſhall not believe that any ſuch office was undertaken by him. The ſame we may ſay of every doctrine of faith; perhaps without Scripture, we might have known ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what confuſedly of ſome of them: as that there is a God, and that the world had a beginning: but we ſhould have known nothing at all of many of them; and nothing diſtinctly of any of them. Theſe we muſt know, and from the Scriptures of God know, or elſe we cannot believe; we may as eaſily ſee, where nothing is to be ſeen, as believe where that is not known which is to be believed. Ignorant perſons therefore, that know not the right hand from the left in religion, and are to ſeek in the very firſt principles of the Oracles of God, in the very beginnings of the doctrine of Chriſt; that either come not to hear, that they may learn, or that learn nothing at all by hearing; <hi>ever learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and never coming to the knowledge of the truth,</hi> are in an inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of faith. Men weak in knowledg can hardly make proof of their faith, they do not well know the nature, or lively workings of it, &amp; ſo want the comfort, but not the thing. Men without know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge, are without faith, &amp; have not gone the firſt ſtep towards it.</p>

That which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we can certainly conclude, we may call knowlege; but that which we believe upon the credit of him that ſpeaks it, that is faith or belief. This is ſo of the being of faith, that without it there is no faith, neither humane nor divine; <hi>The Nobleman of Iſrael,</hi> 2 Kings 7.1. <hi>Zachary</hi> the father of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> Luk 1.18. <hi>Martha,</hi> John 11.39, 40. were all of them herein faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:168215:263"/> This Truth of God, was above their reaſon, and therefore they ſuſpended their faith in it. We believe not what man ſaith, when we do not aſſent to the truth of that which he ſpeaks: and we believe not what God ſpeaks further then we aſſent to the truth of his Word. Thus far the devills go, having ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent experience of the Truth of God; and thus far and further we muſt go, if we be in the faith. Now this aſſent hath theſe two properties; firſt, It is <hi>Firm;</hi> ſecondly, <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlimitted, abſolute,</hi>

Not alwaies free from aſſaults and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; Satan and our own hearts will muſter up objections, but ſuch that yeilds not, but withſtands, and overcomes doubtings, holds firm to truth when all means are uſed to wreſt from it. Herein <hi>Eve</hi> failed, God had ſaid, <hi>The day that ye eat ye ſhall ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly die;</hi> Satan brought ſuch objections, that upon his word ſhe believed, that ſhe ſhould procure good to her ſelf,<note place="margin">2. Abſolute and unlimited.</note> and not incur evil by eating, and ſo yielded to unbelief, upon Satans reaſonings. As our aſſent muſt be firm, ſo alſo abſolute and unlimitted to the whole of all that God ſpeaks, ſuch was the faith of <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 24.14. <hi>Believing all things which are written in the Law, and the Prophets:</hi> and Chriſt blames the two Diſciples that their faith was not ſuch, <hi>Luk,</hi> 24.25. How little honour do we give to man, when ſometimes we give credit and belief to that which he ſaies, becauſe we ſee reaſon and probability of truth in his words, and at other times call all to queſtion that he ſpeaks? ſuch is the honour that many give to God, when they pick and chooſe in believing, as they do in obeying. Promiſes muſt be believed in the way of Gods tender of them, with limit to the conditions annexed to them; Threatnings muſt be believed upon thoſe grounds that they are menaced; commands muſt be believed, that is Gods ſoveraignty in them, the juſtice and equity of them and a neceſſity of our yielding to them. As it muſt be an aſſent to the whole Word of God: So it muſt be an aſſent to it, in that ſenſe as God propounds it. The Word in that ſenſe that it gives of it ſelf, is the Word of God, and not otherwiſe; when we put our ſenſe upon it, we make it our word not Gods. Where we muſt not condemn all for unbelief, that are any waies ſubject to miſtakes, or that through weakneſſe of judgment, do not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend every thing as it is. Willing and wilfull wreſtings of the Word are here ſpoke againſt: when carnall reaſonings, out of ſingularity, vain-glory, carnall contentment, hope of gain, and
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:168215:264"/> admiration of men are ſet up againſt the Truth of God; if we ſhould go no further in our ſcrutiny, how many would be found unſound in the faith? Have we not thoſe that are ſo far from any cloſe adherence to truth tendred, that every wind toſſeth them to and fro, and drives them up and down? that hold no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in an opinion, then a mimick gallant keeps in a faſhion, and change their faith as theſe do their dreſſe? Have we not thoſe that believe, where they liſt; and that is, where it may ſerve for their advantage, or repute, but where they liſt not, they can deny all faith to any truth that God ſpeaks, &amp; deny it they wil, where they ſee it tends to their danger? No ſwearer, no drunkard, no adulterer, no extorting oppreſſor, &amp;c. can believe the truth of God in his Word; but he muſt with it believe his own condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">2. In the will with the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note>But faith is a work of the whole ſoul, and implyes the will with the affections, as well as the underſtanding. Faith is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt in Scripture, by <hi>our coming to Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 6.35. And that is a work of the will, and not of the mind: of the judgement, and not of the affections. It is called a receiving of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. this is alſo done by the will and affections. Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and deliberation are works of the underſtanding; but choiſe and imbracing, are works of the will; when the woman of <hi>Samaria, Joh.</hi> 4.29. ſaith, <hi>Is not this the Meſſiah?</hi> There was matter of conſideration, and deliberation; there was work for the underſtanding to be imployed in; whether he were to be acknowledged indeed the Meſſiah. But now to leave all, and follow Chriſt, to forſake all, and cleave to him: This is matter of choiſe, and work for the will and affections, whoſe work it is to take, or refuſe. Therefore as faith is ſet out in Scripture by words implying knowledge, and aſſent; ſo likewiſe by words implying affiance, truſt, rolling, caſting a mans ſelf on the Lord. Faith then takes Chriſt, and cleaves to him; in all of thoſe relations in which a Chriſtian ſtands to Chriſt, takes Chriſt and lookes for no other delight or comfort; takes Chriſt and will not indure any other Lord, or commander; takes Chriſt and lookes for no other helper; takes Chriſt and lookes for no other Saviour; takes Chriſt as a Saviour, and truſts in him; takes Chriſt as an husband, and delights in him; takes Chriſt as a Lord, and obeyes him. Thus according to the ſeveral offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that Chriſt does, there are ſeveral actings of faith for to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:168215:264"/> The great work of Chriſt was, <hi>to give his ſoul an offering for ſin,</hi> to ſhed his blood to take away our guilt, there faith anſwers, and it is not alone ſaid, that they <hi>that believe are juſtified from all things from which they could not be juſtified by the Law of Moſes,</hi> which might imply no more then a qualification of the perſon to be juſtified; but it is further ſaid that Chriſt is <hi>ſet forth a propitiation through faith in his blood,</hi> Rom. 3.25. which plainly denotes the inſtrument whereby we have our intereſt. When there are many acts of faith, that which reſpects his blood, alone doth juſtifie. Chriſt is ſet up as a King, and hath all things put in ſubjection under him. Here faith yields up all to him, and conſents as to be ſaved, ſo to be ruled by him. Chriſt in his Kingly power protects as well as commands; as he holds out a Scepter, ſo he is a ſhield. Faith flyes unto him for ſhelter, and ſo receives and quenches all Satans darts. Chriſt is given as an head to his body the Chuch, not onely for command, but for quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and enlivening power, to ſupply with vitall energies every part and member. Here faith anſwers, and takes in from Chriſt the Spirit by the promiſes for life and power; and ſo the life, that we live in the fleſh, is by faith in Chriſt Jeſus. So that faith I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe may be fitly defined to be, <hi>A firm aſſent of mind to the whole truth of God, in the way that he doth reveal it, with an acceptation of all that good which God confers by Chriſt in the way that he doth ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</hi> I know this grace is diverſly held out, and is ſo compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive, that the full nature of it is not eaſily laid open; A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon definition of it is, that it is, <hi>A reſting upon Chriſt alone for ſalvation;</hi> purpoſely given, to correct their miſtake, that have made aſſurance, or a full perſwaſion that what Chriſt hath done, I ſhall enjoy in particular, to be of the nature and eſſence of faith. But though this may vertually comprize all that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in this grace, yet it is no full and explicite definition of it; for unleſſe the underſtanding give its aſſent that ſalvation is alone by Chriſt, the will cannot reſt upon him for it. This aſſent in that definition is preſuppoſed: But it is convenient that it ſhould be expert. Other things beſides ſalvation are received by faith from Chriſt, but ſalvation is the moſt eminent and principall, and all other as by conſequent depend upon it. This that I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, is more explicitely full; not onely virtually, but expreſly holds out all that faith compriſeth. And as all of thoſe are here as we have heard convinced of unbelief, that know not thoſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary truths that God hath made known, and upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:168215:265"/> can give no aſſent, together with thoſe that believe, even in neceſſary and fundamentall doctrines, otherwiſe then God hath revealed, that pick and chooſe in doctrines of faith, aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or denying aſſent at pleaſure; So alſo all thoſe that give other things the preheminence above Chriſt, or at leaſt take them in in coordination with him. When Chriſt is offered in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to the ſoul, and men are urged by his Miniſters to receive him, for life and happineſſe, the things of the world are ſtill ready to make tender of themſelves: <hi>The luſt of the eyes, the luſt of the fleſh, the pride of life;</hi> that is, profits, pleaſures, honours; When theſe are hugged, proſecuted, and followed, Chriſt is refuſed and ſlighted. A covetous man will make ſail of Chriſt for a piece of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; he will lay out more ſtrength of affection to compaſſe earth, in the way of a calling, then to compaſſe Chriſt in Ordinances. The man of pleaſures will ſell Chriſt for his cups, for his ſports, for his wantonneſſe; the like we may ſay of the man of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. He that for the cauſe of Chriſt can forſake and abjure all, is the onely man in whom Chriſt by faith makes his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The neceſſary nouriſhment of faith.</note>Thus we have ſeen the two firſt wayes for the tryal of faith: the third followes, which is, <hi>The means appointed for the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſtrength of it.</hi> It cannot live unleſſe in the uſe of means it be kept up. Declenſions are apt to appear in ſoul as well as in body. He obſerves little about his ſpiritual eſtate, that does not ſee his faith oftentimes apt to languiſh as well as his health. And though we be kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation; yet it is in the uſe of means, and not otherwiſe. He therefore that lives in faith, is careful in the uſe of means to keep faith alive. The means appointed of God for this end are eſpecially, the Word, Sacraments, and Prayer. The Word<note place="margin">1. The Word.</note> is food as well as ſeed; as it plants, ſo it waters; as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, ſo it perfects the work of grace. When <hi>Paul</hi> left the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> whom he had begotten to the faith through the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; he leaves them this Legacy, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.32. We are <hi>born again of the immortal ſeed of the Word,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.23. and <hi>as new born babes,</hi> we muſt deſire the <hi>ſincere milk of the Word, that we may grow thereby.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.2. No man ever knew a child live without the breaſt, or other ſuitable means for nouriſhment; Nor men of ſtrength without anſwerable ſuſtenance; no more can a man in grace live without the Word of grace. Our imaginations and
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:168215:265"/> carnal reaſonings will be ſtirring and working, and faith hath not a more deadly enemie. The Word which is the ſword of the Spirit, muſt beat thoſe down, and hold them under, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. The word of promiſe underproppes our faith, and muſt be frequently heard, diligently heeded, or elſe it cannot be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held. Thoſe therefore that prize the Word, as a child the dug, eſteeming it with <hi>Job,</hi> as their ordinary food, <hi>Job.</hi> 23.12. and to this end, to keep life in their ſouls, faith in their hearts; here is a ſign both of life and growth: but when it is with men, as with <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſſe, their ſoul loatheth this heavenly Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, as light bread; having their appetite far better pleaſed with other things, their ear being of the temper of <hi>Jeremies</hi> hearers, <hi>The Word of the Lord is a reproach to them, they have no delight in it,</hi> Jer. 6.10. theſe never had faith in the power and life. And all they that loſe in their love to the Word, loſe alſo in their faith. Many here might be convinced to be wanting in this righteouſneſſe upon their want of faith to intreſt themſelves in it. 1. Thoſe that take themſelves to be above any neceſſity of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, having learnt as they think ſo much, that they may now well lay aſide their teachers. God vouchſafing of grace thoſe gifts for the perfecting of the Saints, having gained (as they think) perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, they matter no more intermedling with them. If theſe could ſhew us any Scripture-Saint, that ever reached to this height, or ever ſet upon any ſuch reſolution; or if they could give ſuch experience to all that know them, that they might know that they want nothing of the higheſt top of perfection, then they ſaid ſomething. But when the higheſt of Saints that we read of in the Word, highly prized the Word, and the more high they were, the more high prize they put upon it, and theſe that upon this pretence reject it, proclaime to the vvorld many vvants in their ſouls; even in that vvhich lyeth at the very bottome of faith, and is of greateſt neceſſity to the being of it, their knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge being but in part, in moſt of theſe very lovv; and little or nothing, vvhere moſt ſhould be knovvn; vve may vvell conclude that all this talke of perfection is vain. Take tvvo perſons, the one of them talking and boaſting of vvealth, &amp; the other labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard in tillage or trade to gain vvealth, and if you can tell whether of theſe, the talker, or the labourer, is like to encreaſe in ſubſtance, then you have determined the queſtion, whether theſe unruly talkers that boaſt of faith, or thoſe that diligently
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:168215:266"/> attend on Ordinances for gaining of it, are more richly ſtored with it. 2. Thoſe that neglect to hear, or hear onely at their idle leiſure, judging a buſineſſe that may be done, but ſee little neceſſity of doing of it, would pretend not to deſpiſe it, yet put a very ſleight eſteem upon it. Doth the child judge ſo of the dug? Or do theſe judge ſo of their ordinary and neceſſary food? A life of nature is kept up in the uſe of meanes as long as it can be patcht up; if Phyſick be neglected, ſo is not food. The Word is food and phyſick for the life of grace, and this is let alone. 3. Thoſe that careleſly, negligently, ſuperciliouſly, and diſdainfully hear, as though their buſineſſe were not to feed, but judge; not to learn or be minded of any thing, but onely to cenſure. According as the way of their fancy works, ſo the Word takes. Some are pleaſed onely with Kickſhawes, like ſuch diſhes on a table, that have ſhew without ſubſtance, words that are quaint and ſtrained, not to help, but to exceed their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings. Others with choyce notions onely; how whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſoever, it is not worth heeding, if not curious. Others take up all according to the perſon that delivers it; with chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren they are pleaſed with every thing from one hand, with nothing from another. Laſtly, Thoſe that let go all truths as ſoon as they are heard; There is no more heard of the Sermon when once it is done. They that go to a feaſt will talk of the diſhes, and they that go to a Fair or Market will talk of the Commodities; but when they go to the Congregation, there is not a ſyllable heard of the Word after they return. When meat goes out of the ſtomach as it comes in, it neither ſtrengtheneth nor nouriſheth; and the Word ſlipt as ſoon as it is heard, can be no more effectual.</p>
                        <p>Sacraments<note place="margin">2. Sacraments.</note> are viſible ſigns and ſeals. That of Baptiſme en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters us into the Church viſible, and ſeals all the promiſes made to members, on Gods terms and propoſitions. And the Supper of the Lord is for confirmation of thoſe that are viſibly Church-members on the ſame terms likewiſe.</p>
                        <p>Baptiſme is paſt in the act; but ſtill preſent in the uſe. As a Souldier by oath taken, and colours given was tied to his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: ſo we are hereby tyed unto God, and God is tyed unto us; and hereby we know our duty, and Gods promiſe. As a leaſe binds to duty and aſſures a benefit, ſo it is with the Sacrament of Baptiſme. The Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. compares it to the Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> he was there toſt up and down in the deep, conſidering
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:168215:266"/> his preſent ſtate, he might well have feared ſhiprack; but the Ark being of Gods apointment, and he put into it by Gods command, he might well confide in him for ſafety. If we look to the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and aſſaults, wherewith our ſouls are on all hands battered, we have juſt cauſe of fears; but when we call to mind that we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Church (as <hi>Noah</hi> the Ark) by Baptiſme, and make it our buſineſſe that conſcience may anſwer unto what Baptiſme re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, what objection ſoever our heart makes, Baptiſme may raiſe our ſouls in confident aſſurance. The Lords Supper is to the eye, as the promiſes are to the eare. Whileſt we are in the body, ſpiritual things under corporal ſigns are ordained for our help and ſtrength. Our Saviour tells us, <hi>his fleſh is meat indeed, and his blood is drink indeed,</hi> John 6.55. And here under the ſigns of that which is our ordinary meat and drink, the fleſh and blood of Chriſt is tendered, and as our food is offered unto us. Where theſe Sacraments have their due eſteem, and men baptized in infancy, do not paſſe by the thoughts of it in their growth, but well conſider their engagements and bonds that lye upon them to preſſe them to duty, and the engagements of God for ſupport of their faith, they then make uſe of this ordinance, to uphold faith and keep life in it, in their ſouls; when they frequent the Lords Table, and conſcienciouſly communicate, for the ends for which it was inſtituted, to be laid low in themſelves, to ſee ſin aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and pardon tendred, there is like hopes: But when all thoughts of Baptiſme is laid aſide, and the Lords Supper either neglected or prophaned; theſe may well look, that as a child through want of food, ſo their faith upon the ſame account may languiſh.</p>
                        <p>Prayer<note place="margin">3. Prayer.</note> is the daughter of faith, and alſo the nurſe or foſter-mother. Faith breathes out it ſelf in prayer, and prayer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a more ample meaſure of faith to pray. <hi>Lord, I believe, help my unbelief, was the prayer of the father of the Lunatick,</hi> Mark 9.24. and <hi>Lord encreaſe our faith,</hi> was the prayer of the Apoſtles, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.5. When we have done all to ſtand, prayer in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>Epheſ</hi> 6.18. muſt ſecond. This Communion with God keeps up faith in God: They that make it their work to pray alwayes, ever holding it up in the ſeaſon of it, joyning with the Congregation in publique, in the family in a way more private, and after Chriſts counſel in their cloſet, ſending forth holy eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations in their beds, their walks, and on all occaſions; Theſe
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:168215:267"/> take care of their faith. But in caſe that may be truly ſaid of them, which was falſly laid to the charge of <hi>Job,</hi> that <hi>they reſtrain prayer before God,</hi> Job 15.4. their faith may juſtly be ſuſpected. I may ſpeak concerning this grace in the words of the Apoſtle, theſe <hi>have not, becauſe they ask not:</hi> theſe ſtarve their faith, and let it dye through want of nouriſhment and ſupport. We hear of Camelions that live in the ayr, and Salamanders in the fire; A Wonder was not long ſince noyſed out of <hi>Germany,</hi> of a Maid that lived onely on the ſmell of flowers; An impoſtor lately went from place to place that fed on ſtones: theſe that would paſſe for believers are ſome ſuch Monſters. Thus we have lookt into faith according to the three firſt rules, the laſt followes, which is, <hi>the fruit that it beares, or the effects that it produceth;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The fruits which faith bears, and the effects which it produces.</note> Theſe might be reduced into two heads. Firſt, ſuch as all faith, if true, produceth. Secondly, ſuch as onely a ſtrong and grown faith obtaineth. But calling men to the tryal whether they be in the faith; and not whether they be high, and tranſcendent in believing; I ſhall wave the latter, and ſpeak onely to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Theſe fruits which every faith (which is ſuch in truth) produceth, are either in the underſtanding, or affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                        <p>For that which it produceth in the underſtanding,<note place="margin">1. In the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</note> take this rule. <hi>Faith puts that high prize on Chriſt, and priviledges through Chriſt, that all earthly things are comparatively of the meaneſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, and moſt low eſteem.</hi> This we might make good in divers inſtances. 1. In <hi>Moſes.</hi> If we read the beginning Chapters of <hi>Exodus,</hi> we may there ſee the ſad afflicted eſtate of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God in that time, together with the honour to which <hi>Moſes</hi> by a wonder of providence was advanc'd. In this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his, and low ebbe of theirs, <hi>it came into his heart to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite his brethren the children of Iſrael,</hi> Act. 7.23. He could not drink wine in bowls, and anoint himſelf with the chiefeſt oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and not grieve for the afflictions of <hi>Joſeph:</hi> and ſee the the Comment that the Apoſtle makes upon it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24, 25, 26. <hi>By faith Moſes when he was come to years, refuſed to be called the ſon of Pharaohs daughter, chooſing rather to ſuffer affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon: Eſteeming the reproach of Chriſt greater riches then the treaſures in Egypt. David</hi> in the Wilderneſſe of <hi>Judea</hi> was perſecuted by <hi>Saul;</hi> all his honours at Court were loſt; yea, all
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:168215:267"/> livelihood and way of ſubſiſtence gone; yet penning a Pſalm in the midſt of thoſe exigents, none of theſe are named on that day that he ſpeaks of the fruition of Chriſt in Ordinances, as, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. may be ſeen. <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 3.5, 6. layes open the rich priviledges that according to the fleſh could be looked after, and ſuch that ſometimes he himſelf did admire, <hi>but theſe things that were gain to him, he counted leſſe for Chriſt;</hi> yea, he profeſſeth himſelf to account them but <hi>dung,</hi> when they ſtood in competition with Chriſt. Compare the greateſt of things that can be in thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and dung together, and theſe will certainly ſtand in a great diſproportion; yet ſuch is the diſproportion between Chriſt and the greateſt priviledges upon earth in a believers thoughts. When the world hath a low and deſpicable opinion of Chriſt, and men of the world are ready to ſay, <hi>He hath no form nor comelineſſe; and when we ſhall ſee him, there is no beauty that we ſhould deſire him:</hi> All that is ſpoke of him in Goſpel-Ordinances, with them is dull and flat; as was ſaid of <hi>Sion, This is Sion which no man looketh after;</hi> So it may be ſaid of the King of <hi>Sion.</hi> Men of faith are of another opinion; He is to them <hi>the chiefeſt of ten thouſand,</hi> Cant. 5.10. and ſtands in their thoughts above all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon. <hi>As the apple-tree among the trees of the Wood, ſo is my beloved among the ſons,</hi> ſaith the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.3. If men would now look into their hearts, whether Chriſt and the great things of Chriſt, or the world and the great things of the world have this eſteem, they might thence draw a ſtrong conjecture whether they be in the Faith, or whether their hearts are void of it; which eſtimate of their Judgments may appear in their care and pains to compaſſe, as alſo in their trouble upon the loſſe that accrues unto them. If their care to compaſſe the world be great, ſo that they riſe up early, and eat the bread of carefulneſſe, the world having all command of their affections to ſcrue them up to it ſelf, and put them on to improve their diligence to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and in the mean time Ordinances are in low eſteem, and every way that Chriſt is compaſſed of mean regard, buſineſſes juſling out prayers, and the week-daye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>Lots</hi> Wives caſe to run away from all, and for Chriſt to leave it to fire, plunder, confiſcation, would not they then with a wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eye look after them, and have ſad parting thoughts about them, inſtead of joyfully ſuffering the ſpoyl of them? And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on apprehenſions that things go ill upon any emergent occaſions at once, to the hazard of outward things, and the endangering of Ordinances, in caſe they are ſenſible of the former, and are as men ſenſleſſe of the latter, having more wiſhes that taxes were taken off, then that the Goſpel ſhould flouriſh; here's a true <hi>Gadarene</hi> that would part with Chriſt rather then his ſwine. The world, and not Chriſt in Ordinances, is the Pearl for which they will make ſale of all.</p>
                        <p>As to the fruit, or effect that Faith produceth in the affections,<note place="margin">2. In the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</note> take theſe rules: 1. <hi>Faith is against all whatſoever that is againſt Chriſt. As it ſets Chriſt in the higheſt room, ſo it oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all that oppoſeth him, and will not ſuffer the moſt deſired luſt that divides from him.</hi> As the covetous mans luſt carries him to his gold, the wantons luſt to his <hi>Dalilah,</hi> the drunkards to his cups, and breaks through all oppoſition in their way of frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them; ſo a believers Faith carries him to his Chriſt, and will not abide any temptation or luſt in his way of intereſt in him, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9. We may ſee that Jewes and Gentiles are either of both of unclean hearts, and that it is onely God that clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and purifieth; as he makes the heart ſoft, ſo he makes it clean; and ſaith is the inſtrument wherewith it is thus clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Luſt defiles, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. and ſaith purifies. It is Luſt that divides from Chriſt; <hi>They that are Chriſt's, crucifie the fleſh with the luſts thereof,</hi> Gal. 5.24. and that upon account of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fruition of him. <hi>She that is married careth how ſhe may pleaſe her husband,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.34. ſhe is not to go in any manner of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>e or dreſſe to pleaſe her ſelf, but in that which may pleaſe him. That which he diſlikes, ſhe muſt caſt off. The believer is betrothed to Chriſt, his care then is to walk in all well-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and to caſt off all that doth diſpleaſe him. If men can do that for Chriſt, which the <hi>Galatians</hi> were ready to do for <hi>Paul,</hi> even to pluck out their eyes for his ſake, rather then loſe him, then all is well; but if they look into their thoughts, and ſee that there is any thing dear unto them which is abhorrent to Chriſt, any thing which they love, that he loatheth, whether it be inward filthineſſe, as pride, vain-glory, earthly-mindedneſſe,
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:168215:268"/> &amp;c. or outward uncleanneſſe, as drunkenneſſe, whoredomes, &amp;c. this evidences a total want of grace in their ſoules. A be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving drunkard, a believing adulterer, a believing extorting op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor, as to aſſent to the doctrine of faith and profeſſion of it, may well ſtand together; and reading the Scriptures, and looking among Chriſtian profeſſours, we may find too many ſuch believers; but as to the grace of faith, they ſtand in full oppoſition to it; and in this ſenſe we may juſtly ſay, there is not a believing drunkard, or covetous worldling upon the earth. As our Saviour ſaid concerning thoſe devils that had held their haunt in the young man from infancy, that his diſciples could not caſt them out becauſe of their unbelief; ſo I may ſay of all that caſt not out theſe luſts. It was weakneſſe in the diſciples faith that diſabled them, that they could not caſt devils out of others: It is want of faith that diſableth theſe that they cannot caſt them out of themſelves. 2. <hi>Faith makes that reſolute choyce of Chriſt, that it ſuffers all manner of afflictions rather than to be driven and divided from him. After ye were illuminated,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle to the believing <hi>Hebrewes) ye ſuffered a great fight of afflictions,</hi> Heb. 10.32. To ſave the labour of turning over large Volumes of Martyrologies, read over that little book of Martyrs, as ſome have called, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. eſpecially, ver. 35, 36, 37, 38. Faith kindles that flame that many waters cannot quench. Chriſt upon earth was a man of ſorrowes, and acquainted with griefs, yet he had thoſe diſciples that never left him, till he came to the Croſſe, and then ſollicitouſly enquired after him. Where Chriſt dwells by faith, there the Spirit ſtrengthens for ſufferings, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.16, 17. If men now look into their hearts, and ſee themſelves willing to follow Chriſt in fair weather, and to own his cauſe whileſt it coſts them nothing, but in worldly reſpects rather gain by the bargain; but when trouble ariſeth, they are gone; Theſe may look into the Parable of the ſower, whether this be not an evidence of a rocky and ſtony heart. A ſtrong wind is the tryal of the root of the tree, of the foundation of the houſe; an hot ſcorching fire of the truth of the mettal. It is true, that ſelf-ends ſometimes put a man upon ſufferings; But it is alwayes true, that ſelf-ends onely put a man upon profeſſion, when he will not ſtand out in ſufferings. They whoſe Religion is the States Religion, the Times Religion, will not loſe an hair by any profeſſion they make; Self and not Faith carries on that
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:168215:269"/> profeſſion. 3. As faith carries the ſoul up to Chriſt to be one with him, ſo alſo it carries it on in every affection and office of love to his brethren. <hi>In Jeſus Chriſt, neither Circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but faith which worketh by love,</hi> Gal. 5.6. It is not to be of this opinion, or of that, which men call their faith; nor of this Nation, nor of that, which too oft preſcribes all that men in their way of faith believe; But to be poſſeſt of that faith which works by love, which commends us unto God. A man may be of this or that faith according to pleaſure, and yet his faith utterly deſtitute of that grace. Faith carries a man not any further at all towards Chriſt then his love carries him on towards his brethren. An idle faith is a dead faith, and a dead faith never reacheth righteouſneſſe to Juſtification and life. <hi>James</hi> never diſputed againſt <hi>Paul's</hi> aſſertion of Juſtification by faith onely: Writing after him (as is generally confeſt) he did not write to contradict any doctrine, or correct any errours de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by him. When <hi>Paul</hi> concludes Juſtification by faith, <hi>James</hi> concludes that it is by a working faith; Where it works not, it doth not then juſtifie; and where it works to acceptation, it works by love.</p>

                        <p>AS a reſult from all that hath been ſaid of the nature and uſe of Sacraments, we may conclude the definite and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct number of them. So many Ordinances that we can find in Old or New Teſtament-Scriptures, that are ſigns and ſeales of this nature, as here hath been ſet out from the Apoſtles words, ſo many Sacraments there are truly ſo called, equally worthy of that honour of Sacraments with this of Circumciſion, being every way of the ſame nature and uſe, they are deſervedly to have the ſame eſteem. But falling ſhort of ſuch, they are to have eſteem as they are, and their dignity may challenge, but not to be put into this number.<note place="margin">The way to find out the number of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</note> And I know no other way then this to find out the ſet and definite number of them. Thoſe trifling arguments made uſe of by ſome, that the matter of
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:168215:269"/> New Teſtament-Sacraments, viz. <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> came out of the ſide of Chriſt, and that <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>water,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> affirms, bear witneſſe on earth, are not worthy to be mentioned, ſave onely that they are uſed by ſome of eminent name. And upon dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſearch we ſhall find onely two ſtated, ſtanding Ordinances in Old Teſtament-Scriptures, and onely two in New Teſtament-Scriptures, that are to be thus received. We have not indeed any diſtinct Text in either of both Teſtaments, expreſly teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying that there are two, and two onely Sacraments, as we find it ordinarily in Catechiſmes. Neither is there any diſtinct Text in the Law or Prophets, that <hi>as we would that men ſhould do to us,</hi> ſo <hi>we ſhould do to them.</hi> Yet our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.12. tells us, that that rule is both in the Law and in the Prophets, being a clear reſult from that which the Law and the Prophets have delivered. The like may we ſay concerning the number of Sacraments. It is as clear a reſult from that which is delivered to us both from Old and New Teſtament-Scriptures; ſo that the concluſion is twofold, drawn by way of deduction of this nature.</p>

                        <p>THe firſt that offers it ſelf is the Rainbowe, of which we might ſpeak; Firſt, as it is in nature, for diſcovery of the phyſical being of it. Secondly, as a ſign appointed of God. But the firſt conſideration of it is not my buſineſſe, but the work of Philoſophers; who out of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> have defined it to be, <hi>A Bowe of many colours ſeated in an hollow and duskiſh cloud,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The definition of a Rainbow.</note> 
                           <hi>appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the reflection of the Sun in oppoſition againſt it.</hi> He that pleaſeth may read further in <hi>Magirus phyſiol. peripat. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>Keckerman Syſt. Phyſ. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>ad finem. Zanch. de oper. Dei, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>Valeſius de Sacrâ Philoſoph. cap.</hi> 9. So that the efficient cauſe is the Sun. The ſubject in which it appeares is a cloud ſtanding in Diametrical oppoſition. The thing it ſelf is the reflex of the Sun. The form and ſhape is a bowe of variety of colours. Whereupon it is generally concluded, that there were bowes of this nature before the flood, the Sun being then in equal vigour to produce it, and clouds in which the reflex might be apparent. And the cauſe being then as well as now in act, the effect muſt needs be likewiſe. But it was from that time, and not before, that it was appointed as a ſign; and under that conſideration we find it mentioned and largely ſpoke to, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.8.<note place="margin">Gen. 9.8, &amp;c. opened.</note> and following verſes, <hi>God spake unto Noah and to his ſons with him, ſaying, And I, behold, I eſtabliſh my Covenant with you, and with your ſeed after you; And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattel, and of every beaſt of the earth with you: from all that go out of the Ark, to every beaſt of the earth. And I will eſtabliſh my Covenant with you, neither ſhall all fleſh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood, neither ſhall there be any more a flood to deſtroy the earth. And God ſaid, This is the token of the Covenant which I make between me and you, and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: I do ſet my bowe in the cloud, and it ſhall be for a token of a Covenant between me and the earth. And it ſhall come to paſſe, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bowe ſhall be ſeen in the cloud: And I will remember my Covenant which is between me and you, and every li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:168215:270"/> creature of all fleſh, and the waters ſhall no more become a flood to deſtroy all fleſh; and the bowe ſhall be in the cloud. And I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlaſting Covenant between God and every living creature of all fleſh that is upon the earth. And God ſaid unto Noah, This is the token of the Covenant, which I have eſtabliſhed between me, and all fleſh that is upon the earth.</hi> In which words we may obſerve, 1. A Covenant entred. 2. The ſign whereby it is ratified and confirmed. In the Covenant it ſelf we ſee, 1. The parties in Covenant, <hi>God</hi> on one part; <hi>Noah,</hi> his ſonnes, their ſeed, every Living Creature on the other part. 2.<note place="margin">The Rainbowe hath reſpect to a Covenant improperly ſo called.</note> The nature of this Covenant, abſolute, and not conditional, as <hi>Pareus</hi> obſerves, and therefore it is a Covenant improperly ſo called, as appears upon a double account. Firſt, In that it is abſolute; when a Covenant properly ſo called, hath its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, as elſewhere I have largely ſhewed. Secondly, In that beaſts and birds, that are here parties in Covenant, are ſubjects capable of receiving mercies, but not of entering into Covenant, no more then the ſtones of the field are of capacity to enter league with man, as, <hi>Job</hi> 5.23. or to be witneſſes in any cauſe, as, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.17. therefore as a bare command is called a Covenant, <hi>Jer.</hi> 34.13. as a bare ſeal is alſo ſo called, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10. ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes elſwhere called a Covenant likewiſe, all of them in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper ſenſe. In the Covenant we ſee the mercy promiſed, ver. 11. not to cut off all fleſh any more by a flood. In the ſign for ratification and confirmation we may ſee, 1. The Author. 2. The ſign it ſelf, the appearance of a bowe. 3. The place of ſituation, the Cloud. 4. The way of ſignification, and that is by inſtitution, as appears in that God ſets it for that very end. Some make the Rainbowe a natural ſign of that which the text ſaith is ſignified by it, which according to them is not that which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally underſtood, that God will deſtroy the world no more by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but onely that no ſuch deluge ſhall at that time come when the Rainbowe appears; ſeeing it is a ſign that the Sunne hath got victory over any ſuch clouds, that might have tendency to ſuch a deluge: So <hi>Cajetan,</hi> as he is quoted by <hi>Rivet exercit.</hi> in Gen. who yet (as <hi>Rivet</hi> obſerves) contradicts himſelf, in that he ſaies any deluge of ſuch kind muſt needs be ſupernatural. It might then come upon the earth, from the hand of God, at the inſtant time that the bowe appears, any ſuch natural cauſe notwithſtanding. It is then,<note place="margin">The Rainbow an inſtituted ſign.</note> no natural, but an inſtituted ſign, to give aſſurance of the fulfilling
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:168215:271"/> of this promiſe. Upon ſight of this bowe, we may call to mind, that it is of free grace, that all fleſh does not periſh, and that the waters that are ſo uſeful to us, do not preſently deſtroy us: and to aſſure our ſelves, that through grace we ſhall be kept from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing. <hi>Pareus</hi> ſaies that the Jewes upon the appearance of the rainbowe, uſed to go out and make ſuch expreſſe acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But open profeſſions of that nature, are in danger to turn to oſtentation, and meer formality, which yet muſt not hold us from our duty in humility, confidence and praiſe to make obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it.<note place="margin">Correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes obſerved by ſome in the Rainbow with the promiſe.</note> Some find fit correſpondencies in the Rainbowe to ſignifie, and ſeal this mercy. Firſt, Becauſe of the place, which is in the clouds of heaven. whence came the rain that drowned the world before. Secondly, Becauſe the bowe is bended upward towards God, not towards the Creature below, as when it is taken in hand, to ſhoot at a mark; nor is there in the bowe any arrow, which is ſaid to be made ready upon the ſtring, when hurt is intended, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.2. Thirdly, becauſe the Rainbowe appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth commonly with rain; and ſo where men might begin to fear the judgment, there they may take comfort againſt it in that it is a ſign of his Covenant for ſafety. Fourthly, becauſe the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowe appears not, but when there is a clearneſſe and brightneſſe in ſome part of the skie, but at the generall flood it was all black with rain. Fifthly, That the Rainbowe conſiſting of divers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, by the watery colour is repreſented the overwhelming rain paſt, and not to return; and by the fiery colour is prefigured the deſtruction of the World by the element of fire, as is foretold, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10. Sixthly, Becauſe the Rainbowe where it toucheth upon any ſhrubs, leaveth a very ſweet and fragant ſmell behind; (as ſome Naturaliſts obſerve) it holds out the pleaſant acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God as a ſweet ſmelling ſavour in his noſtrils. But ſeeing that theſe are not taught us in the Word, but found out by men, and <hi>Zanchy</hi> ſaies of them, that they are <hi>piae,</hi> but <hi>parum firmae,</hi> I ſhall paſſe them by. And to wind up all that we have to ſay of this thing,<note place="margin">How far the Rainbowe is Sacramental.</note> we ſee; Firſt, How farre there is an agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Rainbowe, and the Sacrament. The Rainbowe we ſee, 1. Is a ſign. 2. A ſign not natural, but by inſtitution. 3. The inſtitution is of God. 4. It is to ſignifie and ſeal a promiſe made of God.<note place="margin">How far it falls ſhort of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> Thus farre it is of Sacramental uſe, yet it falls ſhort of a Sacrament properly ſo called in ſeveral particulars. 1. Sacraments are ſignes and ſeales of a Covenant properly ſo
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:168215:271"/> called; but here is no Covenant, but ſuch as is Synechdochically, and improperly ſuch as we have heard. 2. Sacraments are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging ſigns, with reſtipulation; theſe are abſolute, nothing at all being called for from man, much leſſe from other creatures. 3. The Covenant people of God are the adequate ſubject of Sacraments; but here the whole world of mankind, and all fleſh is entitled. 4. This is onely to be ſeen as it is ſet of God in the Cloud; but Sacraments are to be received, upon tender from God, and not onely beheld. 5. Sacraments are ſeales of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of faith appointed for ratification of ſpirituall and ſaving mercies; but this is onely a ratification of a temporal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance. As to this laſt diſſimilitude perhaps ſome exceptions might be taken. As the Rainbowe was immediately a ſigne and ſeal of a temporal mercy, ſo it was with the Paſſeover in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The freedome of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> when the firſt born were deſtroyed, ſeems to have no more ſpirituality in it, then our ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from a deluge. And in caſe we make that of <hi>Egypt</hi> a type of a further deliverance in Chriſt, ſo we may make this deliverance a figure of like mercy, and ſo <hi>Zanchy</hi> indeed makes it. And the laſt Annotations hint ſuch a thing, <hi>Though this Rainbowe</hi> (ſay they) <hi>be a ſign of a temporal Covenant in the general extent of it to all creatures, yet the Godly may look upon it with reference to Chriſt, in whom all promiſes of what ſort ſoever, are Yea and Amen, and who is repreſented ſitting in his throne, compaſſed with a Rainbowe in light like unto an Emerald,</hi> Rev. 4.3. And in caſe this ſign had been peculiar to the Church, as was that deliverance in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and given of God, onely to his people in Covenant; and in New Teſtament-Scriptures ſo applyed, as that of the Paſſeover is, it had been unqueſtionable: but being common to the world, all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the world having like intereſt in it, and there being no touch of it in New Teſtament-Scriptures, it cannot be ſo concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Onely we may ſafely yield thus much, that as the godly may ſee a ſon-like title to every common mercy in Chriſt, and not barely as they are to others, a commmon providence and largeſſe: ſo they may ſee the Rainbowe ſhadowing out a like mercy; but in caſe this would conclude it to be a Sacrament, every creature enjoyed by a Child of God, would have the nature of a Sacrament likewiſe.</p>

                           <hi>SECT. III.</hi> Sacrifices not Sacraments.</head>
                        <p>THe next Old Teſtament-ordinances that offer themſelves, as of the nature of Sacraments, are ſacrifices. Theſe being of ſeveral kinds are uſually ranked under four heads, <hi>The Burnt-offering, The Sin-offering, The Treſpaſſe-offering, and the peace-offering.</hi> Some of which alſo admit of ſeveral ſubdiviſions. Other diſtributions of them are alſo made by ſome under other notions, which would be beſides my purpoſe particularly to mention. There is much agreeable to the nature of Sacraments in them. 1. They had their inſtitution from God, as we may ſee in the Levitical Law, and ſo had all ſacrifices that from the beginning the people of God did offer. By <hi>Faith Abel offered a more excellent ſacrifice then Cain,</hi> Heb. 11.4. And nothing can be done in faith without warranty of a Divine preſcript. 2. Theſe were given in command of God, to his people in Covenant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.5. <hi>Gather my Saints which have made a Covenant with me by Sacrifice.</hi> 3. Chriſt was held out in theſe Sacrifices, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the righteouſneſſe of faith ſignified, as the whole body of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> ſhewes. Some therefore will have them to be Sacraments properly ſo called, and are angry at that Divinity, as they call it, magiſterially impoſed by ſome, that the Jews had but two Sacraments, Circumciſion and the Paſſeover; and oppoſe againſt it, the <hi>Cloud,</hi> the <hi>Sea</hi> which <hi>Iſrael</hi> paſſed through, and <hi>Manna,</hi> and the <hi>Rock,</hi> which were to them in ſtead of the Lords Supper; and alſo the Sacrifices under and before the Law, appointed to the people of God. And doubtleſſe they had much of Sacramentality in them, being external rites appointed of God for his people in Covenant, Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them unto Chriſt and remiſſion of ſinnes by his blood, and the Church (as it appears) for a long time had no other; yet doubtleſſe there are differences to be aſſigned between them. 1. Sacrifices were received of God from the hands of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, being given to God by man, they were accepted of him. <hi>If the Lord were pleaſed to kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering, and a meat-offering at our hands,</hi> Judg. 13.23. But Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments (as we have heard) are given of God to be received of his people; <hi>Abraham</hi> offered Sacrifice to God, but he received
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:168215:272"/> Circumciſion from God; And the Paſſeover was to be eaten by thoſe of the family, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.4, 10. And though perhaps it may be proved, that the people had liberty to eat of ſome of their Sacrifices, yet that was not the proper end, and reaſon of them, as it was of the Paſſeover. The people brought them to offer rather then to eat of them. 2. Theſe Sacrifices led men unto Chriſt for attonement, by him to attain it; Sacraments are to ſeal up an attonement made, and already actually perfected, upon Gods terms to be applyed to us in particular. And ſo their difference from Sacraments properly ſo called is evident.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Exod. 13:21, 22. opened.</note> 
                           <hi>and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light, to go by day and night. He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people.</hi> As alſo, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.19, 20. <hi>And the Angel from God, which went before the camp of Iſrael, removed and went behind them: and the pillar of the Cloud went from before their face, and ſtood behind them. And it came between the Camp of the Egyptians and the Camp of Iſrael, and it was a Cloud and darkneſſe to them, but it gave light by night to theſe. So that the one came not near the other all the night.</hi> Which is further enlarged in other texts of Scripture, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.15, &amp;c. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.14. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.33. with obſervations upon it, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 98.14. concerning which many queſtions are multiplyed, of which ſome are not ſo needful to be anſwered. 1. For the <hi>number,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Whether there were two clouds or onely one?</note> whether there was one onely Cloud or two? The text quoted, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.21.
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:168215:273"/> ſeems to imply that there were two Clouds; one dark, and the other bright, but the other text, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.20. as alſo, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.21. rather makes it to be onely one, dark on the one part, and bright on the other, which ſeems more probable. The firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fitly underſtood of the various appearances of one and the ſame Cloud,<note place="margin">The Cloud not ordinary but ſupernatural.</note> and not a variety of Clouds. 2. For the <hi>nature</hi> of it, or matter whereof it did conſiſt, which doubtleſſe was Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, and extraordinary. Had it been of the common na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Clouds, which is a thick moiſt exhalation drawn up by the heat of the Sun, it could not have been of ſo many years durance, neither could it have ſubſiſted at all elſewhere, then in the middle region of the air. The reflex from the earth would ſoon have diſſolved it. 3. For the <hi>Motion</hi> of it, It is plain that it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the motion of the heavens,<note place="margin">The motion of it guided by an Angel.</note> ſo it could not at any time have ſtood ſtill; neither was it carried at all uncertainty with the blaſts of winds as ordinary Clouds are, but the motion was ordered according to the good pleaſure of God, by the Miniſtery of an Angell,<note place="margin">The form of it was in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance as a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</note> 
                           <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.9. 4. For the <hi>Forme</hi> of it, it was in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance as a pillar.

Had it been of any greater breadth, it had hindred the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> proſpect; and had it not been of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent height, it could not have been viſible for the guidance of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in that diſtance in which many of them were often from it. The <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> is that which is moſt conſiderable and that was two-fold.<note place="margin">The uſe of it. 1. As Iſraels guide.</note> 1. As <hi>Iſraels guide,</hi> as, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. is fully held forth. When the Cloud ſtood ſtill, they were to keep in their quarters, and when that moved they were to march, and to march that way that it led. This was the conſtant uſe of it, as the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 98.14. obſerves, and alſo the Levites on their day of <hi>Iſraels</hi> humiliation, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.19.2. As <hi>Iſraels guard,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2. As Iſraels guard.</note> Exod. 14.19, 20. It uſed to be in the van, now it was placed in the reare. It had formerly gone before them as a guide, but now it ſtood behind them as a guard; ſo that <hi>Egypt</hi> eagerly ſet upon the purſuit of them could not come near them. Of this the Pſalmiſt takes notice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 150.39. <hi>He spread a Cloud for a covering, and a fire to give them light by night;</hi> ſo that here God was a Sun and ſhield.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond obſervable providence is, <hi>Iſraels paſſage through
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:168215:273"/> the Sea,</hi> which we find, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.21, 22.<note place="margin">Exod. 14.21, 22. opened.</note> 
                           <hi>And Moſes ſtretched out his hand over the ſea, and the Lord cauſed the ſea to go back by a ſtrong Eaſt-wind all that night, and made the ſea dry land, and the waters were divided. And the children of Iſrael went into the mideſt of the ſea upon the dry ground,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Several things obſervable in <hi>Iſraels</hi> paſſage through the Sea.</note> 
                           <hi>and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.</hi> With frequent Scripture-obſervations upon it, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 114.3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.29. In <hi>Moſes</hi> words we ſee; Firſt, <hi>The Author</hi> of this great work, and this is twofold; 1. Principal, the Lord. 2. Secondary, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtretching out his hand upon the ſign gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Secondly, <hi>The inſtrument,</hi> a ſtrong Eaſt wind imployed of God to force the waters againſt their natural current. In which we ſee, 1. <hi>The continuance</hi> a whole night. 2. <hi>The effect</hi> that it wrought, to divide the waters, and to make the land dry; God will keep up his agents untill his work be done. 3. <hi>Iſraels paſſage,</hi> They went into the midſt of the ſea up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the dry ground. 4. <hi>Their ſecurity,</hi> The waters were a wall unto them on the right hand, and on the left. Some have thought, that there were ſeveral diviſions of the ſea into parts, according to the ſeveral tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but this is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ground; all that we can collect is, that the whole of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and of thoſe that joyned themſelves to them had a ſafe paſſage made them; they all went out, both old and young, ſons and daughters, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.9. and all theſe had a paſſage cut to their hand.</p>
                        <p>The third remarkable providence is <hi>Manna,</hi> The narrative of it we may ſee, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.14, 15.<note place="margin">Exod. 16.14, 15. opened.</note> 
                           <hi>And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderneſſe there lay a ſmall round thing, as ſmall as the hoar-froſt on the ground. And when the children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſaw it, they ſaid one to another, It is Manna; for they wiſt not what it was. And</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid unto them, This is the bread that the Lord hath given you to eat,</hi> and mentioned in ſeveral other Scriptures, <hi>Num.</hi> 11 7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.24. <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.3. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.20. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.31, 49, 58. Several remarkable occurrences might be obſerved about it, which is not needful to ſtand upon.<note place="margin">From whence Manna hath its name.</note> It had the name from the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> queſtion upon the ſight of it, not knowing it they ſaid <hi>Manhu,</hi> which is, <hi>what is this?</hi> It was given to <hi>Iſrael</hi> upon their complaint againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> that they had brought them forth out of the land of <hi>Egypt</hi> to kill them with hunger, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.3, 4. And it continued with
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:168215:274"/> them till they came into the Land of <hi>Caanan,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The time that it did continue with <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                           </note> and had eaten of the old Corn of the Land, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5.12. Whether it were of the ſame kind, with that which at this day in ſeveral Countries is found, is much diſputed; but whether it were the ſame, or in nature differing from it, it was certainly miraculouſly provided to their hands,<note place="margin">It was miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> otherwiſe it would have been found in that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, both before and after thoſe fourty years of <hi>Iſraels</hi> travels through it.

Not that the Angles feed upon it, but by reaſon of the excellency of it, as the tongue of him that excells is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the tongue of Angels, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1. Though that which ſome talke of the rarity of it,<note place="margin">A fable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</note> and would gather out of the Wiſdom of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Chap. 16.20, 21. that it was fitted to every mans taſte, and as any did fancy, ſo it was. If any did deſire to eat of an Egg, that was turned into an Egg, or to eat of an Hen, or Lamb, that was forthwith turned into ſuch a diſh, (and ſo was a figure of tranſubſtantiation) may well be reckoned amongſt the Legend-tales. Then the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> would never have complained that their ſoul loathed that light bread, <hi>Num.</hi> 21.5. Nor had they had cauſe to have ſaid, as they did, <hi>Num.</hi> 11.4, 5, 6. <hi>Who ſhall give us fleſh to eat? We remember the fiſh which we did eat in Egypt freely: the Cucumbers, and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, and the Leekes, and the Onions, and the Garlick; but now our ſoul is dryed away; there is nothing at all, beſides this Manna before our eyes.</hi> They might (according to this fancy) have found fleſh, fiſh, cucumbers, melons, leekes, onions, garlick, and all things elſe in the Manna it ſelf, unleſſe any will turn it into an Allegory, that that which anſwers to all is found in Chriſt whom Manna did typifie.</p>

<pb n="525" facs="tcp:168215:274"/> Rocks being above all other things immovable: The Jewiſh fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that it was carried thoſe fourty years on Chariots in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe is not worthy to be named, in order to our inquiry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. This muſt be taken for granted, that the Rock it ſelf is not here intended as a ſign, but the water flowing out of the rock; As the cup is not the blood of Chriſt in the New Teſtament, but the fruit of the vine that is in it, and this of following the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> being referred to the water which flowed out of the rock. That reſolution which is generally received, is moſt probable, that many running ſtreames, were framed to draw the water along, according to their ſeveral ſtations, and removals, to which <hi>River</hi> wil have that ſong, <hi>Num.</hi> 21.17, 18. to allude, <hi>Spring up O well, ſing ye to it; The Princes digged the well, Nobles of the people digged it by the direction of the Law-giver with their ſtaves.</hi> But if we referre it to Chriſt, the thing ſignified as <hi>Diodate</hi> on the words ſayes, <hi>it is very properly ſpoken;</hi> for <hi>not onely his benefits are perpetual, but he himſelf who is the ſpring of them, is ever ſeparated from his, but reſideth alwayes in and with them by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> If now we look upon theſe reſpective ſigns with our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, and St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Comment upon them, we ſhall not find for the time that they were in uſe, any thing that ſerves to make up the proper nature of Sacraments that was wanting in them.<note place="margin">All that is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments was found in theſe providences during the time that they ſerved the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>
                           </note> And the Apoſtles hope at which, it appears, he aimes when he ſpeaks of theſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1, 2, 3. plainly doth evince it. The <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> taking themſelves to be high in the favour of God, by reaſon of their priviledge of Baptiſme, and the Supper of the Lord, the Apoſtle lets them know that the Jewes had that which anſwers to our Baptiſme; figuring out ſalvation by Chriſt to them, as Baptiſme to us: They were all baptized unto <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Cloud, and in the Sea. As the deliverance of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> was a figure of their redemption by Chriſt; and their pilgrimage through the wilderneſſe, an image of the Elects life in the world; and the Land of <hi>Caanan,</hi> a ſhadow of that Kingdom of heaven: ſo their paſſage through the Red-Sea, and their being under the Cloud, were a ſacred figure, correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent to Baptiſme; And Manna, and the water coming out of the rock, a ſign which had its relation to the Lords Supper. And our Saviour applyes that type of Manna to himſelf, as we ſee, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. throughout. When the Jewes ſaid, v. 31. <hi>Our Fathers did eat Manna in the wilderneſſe,</hi> quoting the Pſalmiſts
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:168215:275"/> words; <hi>He gave them bread to eat:</hi> Chriſt anſwers, <hi>Verily, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I ſay unto you, Moſes gave you not that bread from heaven, but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.</hi> And upon their requeſt, <hi>Lord, evermore give us of this bread,</hi> v. 34. he anſwers, v. 35. <hi>I am the bread of life, he that cometh to me ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth on me ſhall never thirſt.</hi> So alſo, v. 49, 50, and 51. <hi>Your fathers did eat Manna in the wilderneſſe and are dead; This is the bread that cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof and not dye. I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if any man eat of this bread, he ſhall live for ever; and the bread that I will give is my fleſh, which I will give for the life of the world.</hi> Here is an outward viſible ſign given of God, and received of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-people, ſealing Chriſt, or righteouſneſſe by Chriſt unto them.

Onely theſe were found with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but for a time, namely, the time of the pilgrimage in the wilderneſſe, when Circumciſion, and the Paſſeover, Baptiſme and the Lords Supper are Ordinances, ſtated and conſtant; therefore the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is, that in Old-Teſtament-times there were onely two ſtanding Ordinances, of the nature of Sacraments.</p>

                        <p>IN the next place we are to make it appear that there are in New-Teſtament-times, onely two Sacraments, Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper. In this we may be more cleare, ſeeing none is ſet up in competition with any fair colour. And here the five ſuppoſitious Sacraments of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> offer themſelves; which are either ſuch which (according to them) belong to all in general, or thoſe that are reſtrained to ſome in peculiar. Of the former ſort there are three, <hi>Confirmation, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> and <hi>Extreame <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction.</hi> Of the latter two, <hi>Orders,</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</hi>

                           <hi>SECT. VI.</hi> Confirmation no Sacrament.</head>
                        <p>THe firſt of theſe is <hi>Confirmation.</hi> For diſcovery of which we muſt leave the fountain of Scriptures, to rake in the dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill of Popiſh Writers. In caſe therefore we ſhould dwell too long in it, the Reader would be in danger to nauſeate it; yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may not be ungrateful to look into it, to ſee the mercy of our deliverance from it. Though they put it after Baptiſme in order,<note place="margin">Confirmation preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Baptiſme.</note> yet with them it goes before it in honour. In Baptiſme we are made the ſervants of Chriſt: in Confirmation they become his Champions or Souldiers; Confirmation therefore perfects what Baptiſme begins: and before confirmation, baptized ones are onely one half Chriſtians; The loweſt Prieſt may therefore ordinarily baptize, and any other upon emergent neceſſity: but the Biſhop onely may confirm. Concerning this the Councel of
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:168215:276"/> 
                           <hi>Trent</hi> hath determined: <hi>If any ſhall ſay, that confirmation of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized ones, is an idle Ceremony, and not rather a true and proper Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, or that heretofore it was nothing but a certain Catechiſme in which young perſons of growth, gave a reaſon of their faith before the Church, let him be accurſed.</hi> And now it is time for all that have ſworn to that Councel to ſee that they defend it. I ſhall briefly out of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> lay down the whole of it. The <hi>matter</hi> of it he laies down in four propoſitions. 1. <hi>Chriſme or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the matter of Confirmation.</hi> 2. <hi>The matter of Confirmation</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The matter of confirmation.</note> 
                           <hi>is not ſimple oil, but oil mixt with balſame.</hi> 3. <hi>Chriſme which is the matter of confirmation is firſt to be conſecrated and bleſt.</hi> 4. <hi>The ointment of Chriſme ought to be made in the form of a croſſe in the forehead of the baptized perſon, that it may be the true and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate matter of this Sacrament.</hi> The <hi>form</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The form.</note> of this Sacrament is this, <hi>I ſign thee with the ſign of the croſſe, and confirm thee with the Chriſme of ſalvation in the Name of,</hi> &amp;c. The fruit<note place="margin">The fruit.</note> of it is, 1. <hi>To conferre grace, to ſtrengthen the ſoul againſt Satans aſſaults.</hi> 2. <hi>To conferre an indelible character whereby men are received into the Army of Christ, as in Baptiſme they are recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into his family;</hi> ſo that it may not be reiterated any more then Baptiſme. The <hi>Miniſter</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The Miniſter.</note> of this Sacrament is onely the Biſhop, and no other; He that adminiſters other Sacraments, hath nothing to do with this Sacrament. The Ceremonies<note place="margin">The Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</note> are two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. 1. At conſecration. 2. At adminiſtration. At conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration<note place="margin">At Conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> there are four Ceremonies. The Oyl and Balſame are bleſſed with prayer, with the ſign of the Croſſe. The Biſhop breaths certain times on the ointment, he ſalutes it with theſe words. <hi>All hail holy Chriſme.</hi> At the adminiſtration<note place="margin">At the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</note> there are eight Ceremonies. There muſt be a Godfather preſent, prayers muſt be uſed over them, the Biſhop gives a <hi>pax</hi> to the party now confirmed, he gives him a blow upon the face, the forehead muſt be bound with a fillet, ſome ſay ſeven daies, others onely three. The head muſt not be waſhed, nor the forehead for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven daies ſpace. It muſt be adminiſtred at the feaſt of Pentecoſt. Laſtly, it muſt be done with faſting. When all this is conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed we may well think that <hi>Auſtin</hi> was much deceived, when he ſaid that the Sacraments of the New Teſtament are few and eaſy. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in order to prove this to be a Sacrament, laies down three requiſites in a Sacrament. 1. A promiſe of grace. 2. An outward ſenſible ſign as an organ or inſtrument to convey
<pb n="035" facs="tcp:168215:277"/> the promiſe. 3. A command of God for adminiſtration. But all of theſe we ſay are wanting in this Suppoſed Sacrament, and therefore according to himſelf it is no Sacrament. The promiſe of grace he thinks he finds in the fourteenth, fiftenth, and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapters of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel:<note place="margin">Joh. 14.15.16. chap.. Luk. 24. Act. 1. vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> where the Holy Ghoſt is promiſed to the Apoſtles, to make them valiant and undaunted in the profeſſion of the faith. And, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. where they are commanded to tarry at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> until they be endued with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from on high. And, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. where they are promiſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive power after that the Holy Ghoſt is come upon them. Here if our Author may be heard, is enough. A divine promiſe, and that in Scripture, made to men baptized, for a larger meaſure of grace, for ſtrength, for confeſſion of faith. But our acute diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſhould ſhew us where this promiſe is made to his Chriſme made up of oyl and Balſame. and thus croſs'd and bleſs'd. 2. He ſhould remember that he himſelf tells us, that the Apoſtles had this promiſe made good unto them without this or any ſign at all. 3. He might have found many of theſe promiſes in Old-Teſtament times, which yet made up no ſuch Sacrament in thoſe daies.<note place="margin">Act. 8.17. vindicated.</note> The outward ſenſible ſign he finds, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. where it is ſaid, <hi>They put their hands upon them, and they received the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> But, 1. Papiſts uſe no impoſition of hands in this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Sacrament. 2. In other Sacraments, both we and they make the outward ſign and matter, to be one and the ſame; why is it then that impoſition of hands is the ſign, and other things the matter? 3. The gifts there mentioned are not ſaving, but miraculous, proper to thoſe times, and not found in ours. 4. Thoſe were conferred before Baptiſme as well as after, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.44. <hi>Who can forbid water that theſe ſhould be baptized, ſeeing they have received the Holy Ghoſt as well as we?</hi> The command from God <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will prove from the Apoſtles uſe of this ſign; <hi>If God had not enjoyned impoſition of hands,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The Apoſtles impoſition of hands no proof of Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> 
                           <hi>they would not ſo ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have laid on their hands in conferring of gifts.</hi> Anſw. 1. we look for a command for that which our adverſaries do uſe, <hi>viz.</hi> their Chriſme, Balſame, Croſſe, and not for impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands, which they uſe not. 2. <hi>John</hi> did baptize, yet our Author will not allow that for a proof that he had a command to baptize. 3. The pen-men of the Holy Ghoſt wrote Scripture, yet that is no proof with him, that they had a command to write 4. <hi>Alex. Hal.</hi> part. 4 quaeſt. 9. affirms that Chriſt the Lord
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:168215:277"/> did neither inſtitute nor diſpenſe this Sacrament as it is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. 5. <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> is more modeſt likewiſe, as we heard before when we ſpake to the Author of Sacraments, confeſſing that their Chriſme is not found in Scriptures, and he excuſes it as not belonging to the being but ſolemnity of Sacraments, therein confeſſing that all that belongs to the being of Sacraments ought to be written in Scriptures. But though his anſwer is more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, yet it is leſſe adviſed; that which all his fellowes make the matter of this Sacrament, he denies to belong to the being of it.</p>
                        <p>The ancient uſe of that which afterwards did degenerate into this ſoppery,<note place="margin">The ancient uſe of confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated into this practice.</note> 
                           <hi>Bellarmine</hi> out of <hi>Chemnitius</hi> layes down in ſix Propoſitions. 1. <hi>When a child baptized in infancy comes to diſcretion, he is to be inſtructed in the principles of Religion, and then to be brought before the Church, and put in mind of his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, how and why he was baptized.</hi> 2. <hi>He is to utter a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his own faith according as he hath learned.</hi> 3. <hi>He is to be examined in the principal heads of Chriſtian Religion.</hi> 4. <hi>He is to be admoniſhed that hereby he now differs from Heathens, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and all of prophane opinions.</hi> 5. <hi>There is to be added an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation concerning the vow of Baptiſme, and the neceſſity of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in the doctrine.</hi> 6. <hi>This is to be concluded with prayer.</hi> And if laying on of hands be uſed, it may be well done, ſaith <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> without any ſuperſtition. But when care in Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing, and examination is wanting, it is no better (ſaith he) then an idle Ceremony, and with addition of the forementioned Ceremonies a meer foppery.</p>

                        <p>THe next that they would obtrude upon us as a Sacrament is <hi>Pennance;</hi> Satan not enduring the grace of Repentance, hath made it his buſineſſe to rob us of the Word, and to bring in that of Pennance in the ſtead of it, leaving little that is of God in it, and making it up with the device of man. It is not
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:168215:278"/> my work in this place to ſpeak to Repentance, as it is held forth in the Goſpel to us, and to be practiſed of Chriſtians, whether as it is inward, the change of the mind and will from evil to good, from Satan to God; or outward, in anſwerable works of obedience. We confeſſe a neceſſity of it in this ſenſe, in the higheſt degree, a neceſſity as well <hi>medii,</hi> as <hi>praecepti,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not onely enjoyned by command from God, but of that neceſſity that ſalvation cannot be obtained without it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.3. <hi>Except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh;</hi> but the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of it, which they aſſert, we wholly deny. Our ſouls ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all made ſhipwrack in our firſt parents, and upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count made lyable to wrath, the firſt plank for ſafety they ſay is Baptiſme; in which all ſin, Original, or Actual, before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted is actually pardoned; and that Sacrament is (as they ſay) of no further uſe, for the pardon of any ſins following af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it. The ſecond plank for ſafety after ſhipwrack with them is Pennance, which is a following Sacrament for remiſſion of ſins, not ſo eaſie as the former; but attended with more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,<note place="margin">The parts of pennance. 1. Contrition.</note> conſiſting of three parts, <hi>Contrition, Confeſſion,</hi> and <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</hi> The firſt of theſe aright underſtood, we willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be a Chriſtian duty, and a neceſſary requiſite to the grace of Repentance, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. <hi>Godly ſorrow worketh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to Salvation not to be repented of.</hi> Upon ſenſe of ſin, we are brought to turn from ſin.<note place="margin">2. Confeſſion.</note> Confeſſion we likewiſe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, knowing with <hi>Job,</hi> that it is an evil to hide our ſins as <hi>Adam, Job</hi> 31.33. and that the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>If we confeſſe our ſins, God is just and faithful to forgive us our ſins, and cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſſe,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.10. But that which they would bring in, which is a whiſper of all in a Prieſts ear, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to take from him ſome bodily Pennance, and accordingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his abſolution, we deny, and well know that it were a vain labour to ſearch into the Scriptures, or antiquity for it. Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction we ſo farre receive, that offenders to publick ſcandal, muſt make that publick acknowledgement, that the Church may with freedom receive them into communion.<note place="margin">3. Satisfaction.</note> But for ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God, we muſt let it alone for ever, unleſſe we will ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſt out of that function, and take it upon our own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; he will never ſuffer that we ſhould be ſharers with him in it, and ſo we ſhould be for ever on the work (as the damned in hell are) and never able to go through with it. This is, as though
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:168215:278"/> a man were fined of his Prince, as much as the ſervant in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable was indebted to his Lord, ten thouſand talents, and ſhould attempt to pay it with a few pence of a counterfeit coyn of his own ſtamp, making good a leſſer crime with high treaſon. And whileſt theſe add all this of their own, they leave out the very whole of that, which according to Scripture is eſſential to repentance, which is a thorough change, and amendment of our wayes. And how they got it into their heads to thruſt it among Sacraments, a man might think of it, even to amazement. And they themſelves are ſo confounded about it, that they know not how to find any thing of a Sacrament in it. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſayes,<note place="margin">Papiſts agree not what that is in pennance that makes up a Sacrament.</note> that they affirm with great conſent; that Pennance is a Sacrament but confeſſes, that there is difference among them, to aſſign what in Pennance is the Sacrament; here then ſure is a glorious agreement. And it were eaſie to multiply arguments againſt it. 1. There is no outward viſible ſign appointed of God in this Pennance of theirs, with any promiſe annext,<note place="margin">Arguments evincing pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to be no Sacrament.</note> which even adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries confeſſe is of neceſſity to the being of Sacraments. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> (who makes every thing to be viſible that is any way ſenſible) ſayes, That both confeſſion, and abſolution, is a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſign in Pennance; ſo that the words of the Pennance-taker, and Pennance-doer concurre together to make a viſible ſign, and this ſign in that way viſible, as he can make it, he onely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, but never proves to have any Divine inſtitution. And his brethren, <hi>Scotus, Major, Gabriel, Dionyſ. Ciſterſienſis,</hi> deny that confeſſion is any part of Pennance, as <hi>Ameſius</hi> obſerves; and <hi>Soto</hi> denyes, that abſolution is any part of it. 2. Repentance was in uſe in the Church, and of equal efficacy as now, when yet by their own confeſſion it was no Sacrament, <hi>viz.</hi> in the time of the Law, in the time of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and of our Saviour Chriſt; and therefore now it is no more a Sacrament then it was then. 3. Baptiſme is of the ſame uſe, and ſerves for the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as that which they imagine to find in their Pennance, and engages to Goſpel-Repentance for remiſſion of ſins. And this is an undoubted confeſſed Sacrament, and there needs not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any fiction of a ſecond. And the Reader may find this ſo at large diſputed in <hi>Chamier, Vorſtius, Ameſius,</hi> that I ſhall ceaſe to add any more concerning it.</p>

                           <pb n="535" facs="tcp:168215:279"/> is induced to this opinion, as he ſayes, becauſe <hi>Luther, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> and <hi>Chemnitius</hi> hold, that the ointment, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. &amp; <hi>Mark</hi> 6. are both the ſame. And he will make an hard adventure towards the loſſe of a Sacrament, rather then he will joyn ſo far with ſuch hereticks in opinion. And this Text alſo together with that of <hi>James</hi> 5.13. is rejected by <hi>Cajetan,</hi> as he is quoted by <hi>Chamier and Ameſius. It doth not appear</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>either from the words, or from the effect that theſe words ſpeak of the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal anointing of extream unction, but rather of that oyntment which the Lord Jeſus inſtituted in the Gospel to be applyed by his diſciples to the ſick; For the Text doth not ſay, Is any ſick to death? but abſolutely is any ſick? And the effect is the raiſing up of the ſick: And it speaks of forgiveneſſe of ſins no otherwiſe then conditional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when extream unction is not given but even at the point of death. And as the form of it ſpeaks, it tends directly to the pardon of ſin. Beſides, James commands that many Elders be ſent for to one ſick perſon, and many for prayer,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Jam. 5.14, 15. vindicated.</note> 
                           <hi>which is not done in extream <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction.</hi> So that when there are but two texts pretended for this Sacrament, one Cardinal hath robb'd them of one, and another of both. Againſt the Sacramentality of this oyl we have theſe arguments. 1. Sacraments are for all the covenant-people of God in general, without reſpect had to this or that condition, and this is for the ſick onely. 2. Sacraments are ſigns and ſeals of ſpiritual grace, this is a ſign onely of recovery from ſickneſſe, being appointed for the ſick to raiſe them up. And whereas it is objected that pardon of ſinne is here mentioned; it is plain that it is onely mentioned in order to the cure of the bodily infirmity, and to be obtained by prayer, not wrought by the oyl. The pardon of ſuch ſinne that may have brought upon the patient any ſuch ſickneſſe, as, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.14. When the Land is under famine or peſtilence, there the Lord ſaies, <hi>If my people that are called by my Name, do humble themſelves, and pray, and ſeek my face, and turn from their wicked waies, then I will hear in heaven, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don their ſin, and heal the land.</hi> The pardon of the Lands ſinne is there in order to the removal of the Lands judgement. The pardon of the ſinne of the ſick patient, is here for his healing likewiſe. Much more might be ſpoke againſt our adverſaries uſe of it. They limit it to Oyl olive, when Scripture ſpeaks of Oyl in general. They muſt have the Biſhops bleſſing upon it, when Scripture hath no ſuch thing; And in Scripture he
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:168215:280"/> that adminiſters a Sacrament, is ſufficient for the bleſſing of it. No one word of their form is found in the Scripture. They never intend recovery when that yet is the whole of Scripture-intention. For a right underſtanding of this text in <hi>James,</hi> about which moſt of the controverſy lyes,<note place="margin">Jam. 5.14, 15. opened.</note> it is not ſo eaſy to determine. It ſtands much upon matter of fact, and we are at too great a diſtance, for any clear diſcovery. It is ordinarily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of a Miraculous power, as that other text, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.13. muſt be underſtood. And the miraculous gift ceaſing, the rite (ſay Divines) would ſoon appear ridiculous; and that it doth ceaſe, we need no more for proof then our own experience; and in caſe it had conſtantly held, it would have been look't upon as ordinary, and not miraculous. But I ingenuouſly confeſſe, I ſee more difficulties attending this interpretation, then I know well how to ſalve. 1. I ſee not in any age of the Church, any rule given to all that were ſick, to look after a miraculous way of healing; but that they made uſe of it as providence extraordinarily did offer the opportunity. 2. Had they had direction from God to ſeek for a miraculous cure, it ſhould ſtill have anſwered their expectation, when yet that is denied on all hands. And whereas it is ſaid, that they that had this power, had alſo with it a ſpirit of diſcerning to whom to apply it; why ſhould then the command be given to all promiſcuouſly to enquire after it? 3. Miraculous gifts were for healing of deaf, dumb, blind, as well as ſick perſons; (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> not impertinently obſerves) why then are onely the ſick here mentioned? 4. It ſeems to imply that all Elders of the Church had this gift of healing, which is contrary to that text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.29, 30. Others underſtand it of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal power in the oyl, but all Elders were not Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, and one oyl would not cure all diſeaſes. Some ſpeak of it as an hieroglyphick or outward Symbol which was in uſe amongſt the Jevves, to hold out any thing that is ſpiritual; but it is very doubtful, vvhether the Apoſtle vvould permit, much leſſe can I think that he would preſcribe the uſe of theſe to Chriſtians. I moſt readily therefore ſubſcribe to that of <hi>Ameſius,</hi> which I confeſſe gave me great content when I found it in him, that ſo I might not be ſaid to be alone in the opinion<note n="a" place="margin">Oleum poteſt Synechdochice poni pro medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camento ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t.</note> 
                           <hi>This oyl</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>may be taken Synechdochically for any healing medicine whatſoever;</hi> And anſwering <hi>Bellarmines</hi> objection, why directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:168215:280"/> is here given onely to the ſick, and not to the blind, &amp;c. he ſaies,<note n="b" place="margin">Conſilium datur tantum de aegrotis, quia non de miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſo uſu olei in genere, ſed de aegrotorum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectione trac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatur.</note> 
                           <hi>that it is given onely to them, becauſe the Apoſtle ſpeaks not of the miraculous uſe of oyl onely, but the way to deal with ſick perſons.</hi> So that miracles where the gift was, are not excluded, but all means, whether ordinary or extraordinary, according to the Apoſtles preſcript, are to be applyed. <hi>The Elders are to be ſent for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>especially for prayer and conſolation; but ſo that the uſe of means upon that pretence be not neglected,</hi> ſo that it is little other, than that which Chriſt gave in charge concerning the damſel that he had raiſed to life, that ſomething ſhould be given her to eat, <hi>Mark.</hi> 5.43. Some, as is ſaid, have made an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay to revive this cuſtome in theſe times, and in their viſit of the ſick, will follow the Apoſtle in the letter, they will pray, and praying will anoint with oil likewiſe. I would that theſe would give ſome diſtinct account of their proceedings. 1. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there are in the world ſo many ſorts of oyl, even beyond number, whether any that is called oyl will ſerve the turn? Trayn-oyl (which yet in moſt places is readieſt) would ſure be thought too groſſe to be imployed in it. 2. To what part of the Patient they do apply it; and in what quantity? In our colder clinates, and eſpecially in colder ſeaſons, in ſtead of hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping perhaps this liquid ſtuffe may ſoon wrong weak perſons. 3. What effect they expect from it; whether corporeal, or ſpiritual, or a mixture of both? 4. Whether they uſe it as an inſtrument, to work that which they expect upon application of it, or onely a ſymbol for aſſurance that God will work? If they make uſe of it as an inſtrument, it muſt either be for conferring of ſpiritual grace vvhich (as vve have heard) is denyed to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental ſignes, or elſe for the obtaining of bodily health; then they muſt ſee that it be <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, othervviſe they are in danger not onely to uſe it in vain, but for harm. If they make uſe of it as a ſymbol or ſign to aſſure that God will work, then let them firſt produce a promiſe: there the effect is attributed not to the oyl, but to the prayer of faith; and ſecondly, let them acquaint us how to diſcern thoſe unto whom we may with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe apply it, otherwiſe we ſhall not onely loſe our oyl and our labour, but expoſe it unto ſcorn likewiſe.

For Sub-Deacons, he ſayes there is not that certainty as of Deacons, yet (he ſayes) it is very probable that it is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:168215:281"/> though he hath ſuch an argument againſt it, as that none but himſelf will be ever able to anſwer. Impoſition of hands, he ſayes, (and proves out of the fourth Councel of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharge,</hi> Canon 5.) is not uſed in it, and yet his whole nineth Chapter is ſpent to prove, that impoſition of hands is eſſential in this Sacrament. It is a Sacrament, ſave onely that it wants the eſſentials of a Sacrament, as do indeed all their five ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ones.

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Everend, Beloved, and much Honoured, I have received your Apologie, according to your appointment, from your Stationer, for which I return you hearty thanks, as for the gift it ſelf, ſo for the pains that you have taken to rectifie me, where, in your judgement, I have publickly ſtept aſide. An error in Divine things, if it ſtand alone, without addition of further aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, is not light. Truth being of ſuch divine excellency, that no penſil can draw out; all deviation from it into op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite error muſt needs anſwer, in black deformity, and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: But when it is not ſimple error, but joyned with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to engage others, it is far above it ſelf in fowlneſs. To reduce a brother therefore, not onely erring, but thus er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, muſt needs be an high, acceptable office of love. But in this, I need to do no more, than to ſay over to you, what you have ſaid to me, in your firſt and ſecond page, which you ſtile your Prologue. In this (if we both ſpeak our hearts &amp; thoughts) we are one. And I wiſh that in all other things, there were a like unity in judgement, and the time I hope (with ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence) is near at hand, that all miſts and clouds will be ſo diſpelled, that we ſhall arrive at perfect union. And as for infinite other reaſons, ſo for this, glory is infinitely deſireable. In order to a right underſtanding between us, I muſt acquaint you, that your firſt words, after your Chriſtian ſalute, have their miſtake, though not much material; whether upon mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:168215:286"/> of my words, when I laſt ſaw you in <hi>Shrewsbury;</hi> or fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in memory, I cannot determine. I told you not, that I had then ſent to the Preſs a treatiſe of the Covenant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, but wiſhed you, indeed, not to be offended, in caſe I ſhould in ſuch a treatiſe, publiſh ſomewhat in the way that you mention. In which I do not barely oppoſe my memory to yours; but alſo the witneſs of the Reverend Brother, whom you know was then preſent: together with the computation of time, which ſpeaks it to me to be above contradiction. It was <hi>May</hi> 3. that we ſpake together; as I well know by the errand, that I had at that time into thoſe parts: and my book ſaw not the light, till towards the end of <hi>November</hi> following; and yet made ſpeedy haſte, after it went out of my hands. I was glad of the opportunity, as of a brief diſcourſe of ſome things, (as the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſcantling of time would bear,) ſo alſo to underſtand your mind, in the thing already mentioned, before any further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, that there might be no unbrotherly difference, which at that time you expreſs'd with all poſſible candor, for my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement in that way. Yet, you now complain, that I have given the firſt onſet, and ſo put you upon a neceſſity of this way of dealing againſt me; which you mention in your Preface Apologetical, and in this Prologue, and more at large in the Preface of your Confeſſion: preferring in your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a more private Collation, and enquiry into things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this publique way of appearing in the Preſs. And indeed, I had it in my thoughts to have written to you, before I had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſetled reſolution at all, any more to have appear'd in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique; &amp; had done ſome little that way, as ſoon as your Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſms came to light, (which was more than three years and an half, before my treatiſe of the Covenant was publiſhed, as may be ſeen, comparing the dates of either) but after-thoughts took me off: And indeed I ſee no cauſe of Repentance; conſidering the iſſue of things between you and others. After ſo much pains of writing on both ſides, I do not hear that any of thoſe eminently learned men, which you ſay from moſt parts of the land have taken this way, to impart their animadverſions, have at all prevail'd to change your mind. Neither do I hear, that any of your replies have wrought any change in them for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. And in the mean ſpace, thoſe elaborate writings on both ſides, are buried in your Study and theirs; and no other,
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:168215:286"/> but your ſelves, have any benefit at all; Only we have their complaints (ſuch is humane frailty) that their names ſuffer in your publick writings. As to the Charge againſt me for making the firſt onſet, <hi>I</hi> had not appear'd at all, had <hi>I</hi> not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other occaſions (which may be ſeen in my Preface) been put upon it, to come out in open view. And how far <hi>I</hi> ſtand guilty of that in which <hi>I</hi> ſtand charged, <hi>I</hi> deſire the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Reader impartially to conſider. In that of Sacramental Seals, you had given me at leaſt ſome occaſion. When <hi>I</hi> had delivered my ſelf in private to you, and alſo made my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment publick, that they ſeal conditionally; you are pleaſed peremptorily to determine the contrary. Herein being not alone unhandſomely cenſur'd by your Quaeriſt, (with whom you there deal) but <hi>terminis terminantibus</hi> by you alſo gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. I indeed make mention of your name, yet ſo, as almoſt wholly agreeing with you in the thing in queſtion, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in ſome notions and expreſſions only. In which, <hi>I</hi> made it my work to beat out the right meaning, for a true under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and in language, <hi>I</hi> hope, altogether without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; And therefore that piece was ſcarce worthy the name of a difference. In one or two more problematicall things, <hi>I</hi> likewiſe mention your name, taking notice of your opinion; perhaps with ſome diſſent, as we are conſtrain'd to deal with all, ſince the pen-men of the Holy Ghoſt compleated that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. But for the points that are worthy the name of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall, (whether allready inſerted into the forgoing treatiſe, or following in this Poſt-ſcript) the Reader may ſee, that your name is not ſo much as once mentioned, unleſſe it be with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. <hi>I</hi> was loath indeed to appear your profeſſed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, and more loath, to honour thoſe Tenents of which I had no other eſteem, with the mention of your name. Had you held like courſe with me, how inobſervant would the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences have been that are between us? Not many that read your Aphoriſms, read my treatiſe, and ſo on the contrary: and all Readers would not have obſerv'd the author of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, when the Man induſtriouſly is concealed. The of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Br.</hi> againſt <hi>Bl.</hi> and <hi>Bl.</hi> againſt <hi>Br.</hi> would, howſoever have been avoided. <hi>I</hi> had indeed many debates with my ſelf, whether or no <hi>I</hi> ſhould not have totally waved all, that in oppoſition to that which <hi>I</hi> intended to publiſh, you had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:168215:287"/> My inclination to peace, and that great reſpect I had to you, led me ſtrongly that way. On the other hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſolv'd upon a tract, in that method, and way, that found you in full opppoſition; Conſcience of duty (to appear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all, where I was convinc'd that truth was oppoſed) put me upon it to deal with your arguments, yet with reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to let alone your name. So, that I think, the indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Reader will judge you, rather than I, (reſpective to theſe bickerings in this Apology of yours, where, in this publick way, you deal with me) to be the beginner. You are pleaſed to tell the Reader in the Preface to your Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that you have uſ'd more care to avoid offenſive words to me, than any other; which cannot but much engage me. But truly Sir, to ſpeak of things, as they are, <hi>I</hi> am apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of not a little gall, in the ink that thou ſpent upon me, and take my ſelf to be much more bedabled through your writings, than the cauſe required. And indeed it is ſeldome the cauſe that <hi>I</hi> defend, that hears ſo much (which yet muſt fall before arguments, &amp; not words,) as my weakneſs, as you endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to hold it forth to your Reader. Were it alone my thoughts, exceptions might ſoon be put in; but being all Readers thoughts, (as <hi>I</hi> think) as well as mine, there is no likely-hood that <hi>I</hi> am much deceived. <hi>I</hi> may over-value my ſelf, but others will not be ſo haſty to put that over-high eſteem upon me. Let your <hi>Index</hi> ſpeak, which appears in the vann; Many eyes will faſten there, that perhaps will look no further; And what honourable language Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> upon all occaſion hears, will ſoon be diſcerned. But <hi>I</hi> hope <hi>I</hi> have learn'd better than to make returnes; If <hi>I</hi> can, <hi>I</hi> fain would avoid it. But to leave the Porch, and to get more neer into the Houſe. You ſee my thoughts in three particulars already laid down, in the preceding treatiſe. <hi>I</hi> was there reſolv'd to wave nothing that fairly came into my way; nor to take in any thing that was impertinent to the work in hand. The firſt, <hi>I</hi> muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, is moſt in my thoughts, <hi>viz. The intereſt that faith, which is ſhort of juſtifying, gives to Baptiſme.</hi> In which you are pleaſed to charge me with a doctrine of a very dangerous nature; Though in all that you have ſaid, <hi>I</hi> hear not a word of any dangerous conſectary that followes upon it. And truly, Sir, if <hi>I</hi> ſhould have a thought of changing my opinion, <hi>I</hi> know
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:168215:287"/> not how to look to the end of the danger that will follow.<note place="margin">Dangers that attend the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of right to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to the- Regenerate.</note> I muſt firſt neceſſarily engage my ſelf, in an everlaſting Schiſm; being not able to find out a Church in the world of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, in which I ſhall dare in this account to hold Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. I ſhall ſee in many members (unleſſe I offer violence to my judgment) too clear ſymptoms of non-regeneration; and unbelief, as to that faith which juſtifies: And though this will not bear a ſeparation (as is clear in all the examples that we find to the contrary in the Scriptures, and the Epiſtles wrote from heaven to the Churches in <hi>Aſia</hi>) yet this conſideration of their non-baptiſm, will neceſſarily enforce it. Church-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not to be held with any that are no Church-members; But all in non-regneration (according to this tenent) are no Church-members, upon account of their non-baptiſm, or their null-baptiſm. And if I meet with men that are able to give a good account, (and as to men ſatisfying) of their regeneration; yet if there ever were a time, ſince their bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, that they were unregenerate, that concludes the nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their former baptiſme. And being Baptized upon the account of their Fathers faith, That failing and falling ſhort of that which juſtifies (as often it doth) Their baptiſme fails; and I muſt upon my new taken up principle, renounce Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, till they have made all good by a new baptiſme. And if I ſhall betake my ſelf to the <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts</hi> (for ſo many of them as I do know, where I now live, or have lived, or hear of by report) I muſt upon all occaſions among them plead for Anabaptiſm; So ſlender ſignes of regeneration, but all on the contrary, being too evidently manifeſted for the moſt part by them. The great reaſon that ever <hi>I</hi> could gather from the principles of <hi>Antipaedobaptiſm,</hi> why God ſhould ſo blaſt that way, whereſoever it appears (as you, after <hi>Bulling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Bucer</hi> and many others, have abundantly ſhewn) is, the Schiſm in which they unavoidably engage themſelves. The whole face of Chriſtianity through the world, had their bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm in infancy; and this proving no more than the ſprinkling of a little common water, and meer mock-baptiſm, they are <hi>eo nomine,</hi> put upon a ſeparation, and neceſſitated to disband themſelves, and deny ſociety to the whole Church on earth. The like will (as appears to me) here follow upon this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, That only the faith that juſtifies, gives title in a man
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:168215:288"/> of years, either to his own (if unbaptized) or to his Childs baptiſme, upon the grounds before mentioned. And If <hi>I</hi> be here holpen out (as indeed <hi>I</hi> utterly deſpair) by any diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Forum Dei,</hi> or <hi>Forum Eccleſiae, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nivocall,</hi> or <hi>Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocall;</hi> what thoughts then ſhall I entertain of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? As you ſay of an opinion that you oppoſe, Confeſs. pag. 5. <hi>when you do but open the Bible, you can ſeldome meet with a leaf that is not againſt them;</hi> And <hi>I</hi> think your <hi>Hyperbole</hi> is very tolerable; The ſame, <hi>I</hi> think, <hi>I</hi> may aſſert of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which here <hi>I</hi> oppoſe, if you except the book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and that needs not wholly to be excepted, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.1. doth witneſſe. After the Church was gathered into a viſible body in <hi>Abrabam,</hi> the leaves are very rare, through the Old and New Teſtament, in which a man may not find, teſtimonies, or inſtances, of a people in Covenant-relation to God, and received by Circumciſion, or Baptiſm, into a Church-ſtate, in an unregenerate condition. Let Mr <hi>Ball</hi> be conſulted in his Friendly tryal, pag. 192. What high titles, implying a Covenant-relation, are given to men of moſt vile qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? To which many more might be added. <hi>They are called (ſaith he) by God himſelf, His People, His Children, A choſen People, An holy Nation, The peculiar People of God, The Daughter of Zion, The Daughter of his People, His pleaſant Plant, A right Noble Vine.</hi> To which may be added, <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Kingdome, Children of the Covenant, Heires of the promiſe, Saints, Believers, Diſciples,</hi> Together with many compe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

May not the worſt
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:168215:288"/> of <hi>Antinomians,</hi> whom you follow with juſt indignation, give like anſwers, and find like ſtarting holds? when they deny any neceſſity of good works, and we bring Scripture Texts in the fulleſt and plaineſt way againſt them, May not they reply, that all this is reſpective to our carriage towards men, and not, as to any notice that God takes of them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as to diſpleaſure or acceptance? That they are not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary <hi>in foro Dei,</hi> but in <hi>foro humano</hi> onely. As <hi>Trask</hi> in a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney that he made into <hi>Stafford-ſhire,</hi> there delivered, That a Chriſtian was to live amongſt men, as though he were under the obligation of the Law of God, (or words to that purpoſe) but muſt not account himſelf obliged. And I once heard one that had got into a Pulpit, pretending to advance Chriſt, (but in ſuch a way, as I hope I ſhall hear no more) mentioning Sanctification, he ſaid, There was ſuch a thing indeed reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to man, but God regards it not; And objecting the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle's words 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. <hi>If there be a willing mind, it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, according to that which a man hath, and not according to that which a man hath not,</hi> This he ſaid was not any accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, but of the Saints. I muſt confeſs the gloſs with me, is alike in the one, as in the other; and either of both, ſuch, as the Text will not bear. Not that I charge all that hold that tenent, as ſo highly guilty. They ſee not (as is plain, in that they deny) the connexion between them, as the Ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitaries deny that any thing that they hold is deſtructive to the humane nature of Chriſt; but with me, the conſequences before mentioned, are palpable. And if on the other hand, when God ſayes <hi>Hear O my people, and I will teſtifie againſt thee, I am God even thy God,</hi> Pſal. 50.7. <hi>I entred covenant with thee, and thou becameſt mine,</hi> Ezek. 16.8. I ſhall believe that God ſpeaks as he thinks; and that this covenant-relation is reall, and not barely equivocal, or nominal; I cannot ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny danger that followes upon it. To leave this to your fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoughts, and the Readers more ſerious judgement, I come to that which is behind, which I think I may reduce to theſe three heads.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Thoſe things, wherein you and I really differ in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.<note place="margin">The Contents of this Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript.</note>

                     <p>In the firſt, I believe your buſineſs is to beat down error, and find out truth; In the ſecond, your end might be judged to be onely to diſcover my weakneſs, (being ſatisfied with my Tenent, but unſatisfied it ſeems with my reaſons) but you profeſs other, and better intentions; In the third, I believe that amidſt what ſeems doubtful, you would fain find out that on which you might fix as certain. In all of theſe I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly be brief upon a ſeveral account. 1. There is none of them in which this Treatiſe doth directly engage me, and that, at this time is my work; And I think I had never appeared at all in any of theſe, had not this work led me to it. 2. I would not be thought to have a mind to differences, when indeed my endeavour is to take my mind off them. 3. I doubt I ſhall put the Reader to too much coſt and pains. The Book it ſelf is of that bulk (though I hope of a neceſſary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject) that he may be tyred, before he comes at the Poſtſcript.</p>

You amplifie your tenth argument, with a large diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and all of this before you can reach my words. <hi>I</hi> ſhould trouble the Reader in his purſe and patience, if <hi>I</hi> ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you in all theſe particulars, and indeed <hi>I</hi> was ſcarce ever brought ſo near to a non-plus. To ſpeak to all, Time will not ſuffer; and to take to ſome, and leave others, will expoſe me to cenſure. Your diſtinctions ſhould be look'd into, and if they had been either proved or explained, you had done your Reader a Favour. Your firſt diſtinction is between <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive Juſtification,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">His diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note>

I</hi> hope you do not make theſe two diſtinct Juſtifications, that ſo it ſhould be a diſtribution of a <hi>Genus</hi> into its <hi>ſpecies,</hi> So <hi>I</hi> think few Readers will own it. But if you mean by the former, a Juſtification wrought, and in it ſelf perfect and compleat, as your word conſtitutive would ſeem to imply; And by Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by the ſentence of the Judge, Juſtification manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and declared, then <hi>I</hi> freely yeeld. That is Juſtification in it ſelf, perfect and full, that renders a man bleſſed; And this your conſtitutive Juſtification, which you call remiſſion by the Goſpel-grant doth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1. Commented upon by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.7, 8. Whether the Elect ſhall have any other juſtification, or this manifeſted, and more fully held out,
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:168215:290"/> let Chriſt himſelf determine. At the day when God by him ſhall judge the world, he will pronounce this ſentence, <hi>Come yee bleſſed of my Father,</hi> Matth. 25.34. This Juſtification then by the ſentence of the Judge is a manifeſtation of this bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is in remiſſion and non-imputation of ſin. Your next diſtinction is between, <hi>Conſtitutive Juſtification as begun,</hi> and <hi>as continued or conſummate.</hi> And here <hi>I</hi> doubt not but you may diſtinguiſh, provided that you donot divide and make one condition to be required for the firſt, (as you uſe to do) <hi>viz.</hi> Faith only, and another (which is works) the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the ſecond; When <hi>David</hi> through faith was put into a juſtified ſtate, and after fell into ſin, there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of his return in the order eſtabliſhed of God. You may ſay, if you pleaſe, that <hi>works</hi> muſt now acquit him from this ſecond guilt: but this <hi>I</hi> ſhall hardly imbrace. He ſought in his faln condition, to have ſin by free grace remitted, and to be purged with that, which Hyſopin Ceremoniall purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did typifie, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.7. A juſtified ſtate is carried on in a way of obedientiall affiance; But faith in Chriſts blood, firſt and laſt doth only juſtifie. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of the falls of the Children of God, when he ſayes, <hi>If any man ſin,</hi> 1 John 2.1. and tels us the way to be acquited, not any new, but the old and firſt way: <hi>We have an Advocate with the Father, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our ſin;</hi> And <hi>I</hi> know no other way of propitiation, then through faiths in his blood. <hi>I</hi> know what you ſay, Pref. to your Confeſ. pag. 8. if <hi>I</hi> number right, <hi>They are very different queſtions, How we are conſtituted juſt, or put into a juſtified ſtate at our converſion; &amp; How we are ſentenced juſt, or juſtified at Gods Judgment ſeat.</hi> You may if you pleaſe make them two queſtions, but were <hi>I</hi> to be Catechized by you, <hi>I</hi> ſhould give you the ſame anſwer. And <hi>I</hi> believe <hi>Paul</hi> was of the ſame mind, when he deſired <hi>to be found,</hi> (as <hi>I</hi> think, in judgment) <hi>not having his own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe which is of God by faith. I</hi> think he could find no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which would be as a Screen, or cover, to hide ſin, or keep off the wrath of God. <hi>He knew nothing by himſelf;</hi> He could not therefore be charged as unbelieving or impenitent; <hi>Yet he was not thereby juſtified,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.4. Be it faith as a work or other work of obedience, they are all within the
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:168215:291"/> command of the Law; and <hi>I</hi> dare not reſt there for Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And the Apoſtle acquaints us with no other way then faith for intereſt in this righteouſneſſe. You farther ſay in in the place quoted: <hi>They that will needs (to the great diſgrace of their underſtandings) deny that there is any ſuch thing as Juſtification at Judgment, mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>t either ſay that there is no Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or that all are Condemned; or that judging doth not contain Juſtification and Condemnation, as its diſtinct ſpecies; but ſome men ſhall then be judged, who ſhall neither be Juſtified nor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</hi> All men have not their underſtandings elevated to one pitch, <hi>I</hi> know no Juſtification to be expected then, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fically diſtinct from that which did precede. <hi>I</hi> would for the bettering of my underſtanding learn, whether this Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation at the day of Judgment be not a Juſtification of men already juſtified, yea of men already in poſſeſſion of their Crown, (except of thoſe who then are found alive) though not compleat, in regard of the abſence of the body; <hi>I have fought a good fight,</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>I have finiſhed my courſe, henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſnes,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.7, 8. At the end of his combat he receives his Crown. This muſt needs be, unleſſe we will be of the <hi>Mortaliſts</hi> Judgment, to deny any ſeparate exiſtence of the Soul; Or of theirs that aſſert the Souls-ſleeping: both of them againſt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, who ſaith, <hi>To be abſent from the body, is to be preſent with the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.8. And upon that account, <hi>had a deſire to depart, &amp; be with Chriſt, Phil.</hi> 1.23. which preſent advantage ſeem'd to him to over-weigh, or at leaſt to ballance all the good that the Church migh reap by his labour ſurviving. Your third diſtinction is between the <hi>Phyſicall operation of Chriſt and his benefits, on the intellect of the Believer, per modum objecti apprehenſi, as an intelligible ſpecies; and the morall conveiance of right to Chriſt, and his benefit, which is by an act of law, or Covenant-donation.</hi> If you call the firſt a Juſtification, then very bad men, in the Church on earth, and the worſt of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils in hell, may be juſtified: They may have ſuch operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon their underſtanding. You ſeem elſe where to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between the acceptance of him by faith, and this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conveyance of right. Your fourth diſtinction is between thoſe two queſtion, <hi>What juſtifieth ex parte Chriſti,</hi> and <hi>what juſtifieth or is required to our Juſtification ex parte peccatoris.</hi>
                        <pb n="559" facs="tcp:168215:291"/> Which as it is laid, is without exception. Your fifth is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>the true efficient cauſes of our Juſtification,</hi> and the meer condition, <hi>ſine qua non, et cum qua:</hi> Which <hi>I</hi> can ſcarſe tell whether to approve or diſapprove; with your comment upon it, <hi>I</hi> have ſpoken to it. Your laſt diſtinction is between <hi>Chriſts meriting mans Juſtification,</hi> and <hi>this actuall juſtifying him by conſtitution or ſentence,</hi> which, as the fourth, is above excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Your propoſitions offer themſelves in the next place to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. You ſay, <hi>Chriſt did merit our Juſtification, or a power to Juſtifie, not as a King, but by ſatisfying the juſtice of God in the form of a ſervant.</hi> This <hi>I</hi> imbrace with thanks, and do believe that it will draw more with it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. You ſay, <hi>Chriſt doth juſtifie</hi> conſtiſtutivè, <hi>as King and Lord,</hi> viz. ut Dominus Redemptor, <hi>i. e</hi> Quoad valorem rei, <hi>he confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it,</hi> Ut dominus gratis benefaciens; <hi>But</hi> Quoad modum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionalem conferendi, Ut Rector et Benefactor. <hi>For it is Chriſts enacting the New Law, or Covenant, by which he doth legally pardon, or confer remiſſion, and conſtitute us righteous, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the condition performed on our part. And this is not an act of Chriſt as a Prieſt or Sacrificer, but joyntly,</hi> Ut Benefactor et Rector. Hereto me are <hi>termini novi,</hi> and <hi>Theologia nova.</hi> But let the terms alone of <hi>Dominus, Redemptor, Rector, Benefactor,</hi> That which you aſcribe to Chriſt in this place, (ſo far as <hi>I</hi> underſtand) Scripture ſtill gives to the Father. Chriſt gave himſelf <hi>for us,</hi> indeed, according to his Fathers command; but the Father gives him <hi>to us,</hi> and he that gave his Son, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points the terms on which Juſtification and Salvation is to be obtained by him, <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not periſh, John</hi> 3.16.</p>
                     <p>So that this New Law (if you will call it ſo) is of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers appointment, <hi>John</hi> 6.40. <hi>This is the will of him that ſent me, that every one who ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlaſting life.</hi> And in this ſenſe, if we will follow Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, The Father juſtifies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. <hi>It is God that Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, whche is that condemneth?</hi> Chriſts work, is to work us into a poſture, to obtain it. The Father judicially acts in it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. You ſay, <hi>Chriſt doth juſtifie by ſentence as he is Judge,
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:168215:292"/> and King; and not as Prieſt. Anſw.</hi> If he juſtifie by ſentence, Then he condemnes by ſentence, when yet he ſays, <hi>J</hi> 1.47. <hi>He judges,</hi> (that is) <hi>condemnes none.</hi> The truth is, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, <hi>God is Judge himſelf,</hi> Pſal. 50.6. and the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteouſneſſe, by the man whom he hath ordained,</hi> Act. 17.31. This unqueſtionably Chriſt doth as King; but in this Kingly power, he is no other then the Fathers Agent, who hath ſet him on his holy Hill of <hi>Zion,</hi> Pſal. 2.6. He is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at the Fathers right hand, as prime in power for that work. Thoſe that are next to him, that is chief, are ſo ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and <hi>Zebedees</hi> Children look'd for it, in Chriſts temporall Kingdome. When this is done, Chriſts mediatory power will be finiſhed, and he ſhall give up his Kingdome to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. You ſay, <hi>Sententiall Juſtification, is the moſt full, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and eminent Juſtification, That in Law being,</hi> quoad ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam, <hi>but vertuall Juſtification. Anſw.</hi> To this <hi>I</hi> have ſpoken upon the firſt diſtinction.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. You ſay, <hi>Faith juſtifies not, by receiving Chriſt as an object; which is to make a reall impreſſion and mutation on the intellect; according to the nature of the ſpecies, I ſay to juſtifie is not to make ſuch a reall change, &amp;c. Anſw.</hi> To this <hi>I</hi> have ſpoke un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that head of the inſtrumentality of faith. The works an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to this of Juſtification, as Humiliation, Regeneration, faith, imply a reall change. Such a change is wrought in the Juſtified Soul, though the act of Juſtification do not work it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. You ſay, <hi>Faith can have no phyſicall cauſation or efficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Juſtification, ſeeing that the work to be done by us, is not,</hi> noſmetipſos Juſtificare <hi>either in whole or in part, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. You ſay, <hi>The legall formall intereſt, or conducibility of faith towards Juſtification, cannot therefore be any other then that of a condition in the proper Law ſenſe, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have ſpoken to both of theſe in the place laſt mentioned.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. You ſay, <hi>Scripture doth not ſay (that you can find) that faith juſtifies, but that we are juſtified by faith, and therefore</hi> (you ſay) <hi>you uſe the latter phraſe, rather then the former. Anſ.</hi> This ſure comes to fill up, or make a number, To ſay that we are juſtified by faith, and not that faith juſtifies, is a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction without a difference: We have warmth by Clothes, but
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:168215:292"/> Clothes do not warm u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. Faith hath no leſſe efficiency in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, then in miraculous cures, and yet in them faith made whole.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. You ſay, <hi>Though</hi> ex parte Chriſti, <hi>our ſeverall changes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from his ſeverall benefits, and parts of his office exerciſed for us; Yet</hi> ex parte noſtri, <hi>i.e.</hi> fidei, <hi>it is one intire apprehenſion or receiving of Chriſt, as he is offered in the Goſpel, which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our intereſt in Chriſt, and his ſeverall ben fits; and the effect is not parcelled, or diverſified, or diſtinguiſhed from the ſeverall diſtinct reſpects that faith hath to its object, &amp;c. Anſw.</hi> It is well that this is confeſſed, on the part of Chriſt. And <hi>I</hi> think you cannot ſhew, why Chriſt ſhould undergo this variety of functions in his Mediatorſhip, and make them known to us likewiſe; That we ſhould be taught in our Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm (which is ſo honoured with your approbation) <hi>That Chriſt executeth the office of a Prophet, in revealing to us by his word and Spirit, the will of God for our Salvation; That he executeth the office of a Prieſt, in his once offering up of himſelf a Sacrifice to ſatisfie divine Juſtice, and reconcile us to God, and in making continuall interceſſion for us; That he executeth the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a King in ſubduing us to himſelf, in ruling and defending us,</hi> if our faith is not to obſerve, which way theſe various priviledges accrue unto us; Why does the Scripture ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly ſpeak of them, if we may not diſtinctly conſider them? Muſt our intellect go without our faith in this thing? <hi>I</hi> think it may be proved, that the Saints faith, hath thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly acted. In danger of enemies they go to God in Chriſt, in conſideration of his ſoveraignty, As <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> 2 Chron. 20.6. <hi>O Lord God of our Fathers, art not thou God in heaven, and ruleſt not thou over all the Kingdomes of the heathen, and in thy hands is there not power and might, So that none is able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thee? &amp;c.</hi> Under a cloud of ignorance to go to him as a teacher, We ſee the cenſure that the Pſalmiſt paſſes upon himſelf, <hi>So fooliſh was I and ignorant, I was as a beaſt before thee,</hi> and preſently addreſſes himſelf to God, <hi>Thou ſhalt Guide me with thy counſell, and bring me unto glory,</hi> Pſal. 73.22, 24. Under the burthen of ſin, to look to be clenſed and purged; To what elſe did the ſacrifices tend? and why elſe did <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> make his addreſſe? <hi>Waſh me thoroughly from my ſin; Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me from blood-guiltineſſe.</hi> Here <hi>I</hi> muſt lay down certain
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:168215:293"/> propoſitions, in a more full way to explicate my ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <note place="margin">Propoſitions tending to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors meaning</note>1. That theſe ſeverall functions of Chriſt muſt be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, but may not be divided; He that is one is all, Chriſt a Prieſt doth rule, Chriſt a King doth merit and teach, Chriſt a Prophet doth both merit and rule: But as a Prieſt he doth not rule, as a King he doth not merit; he is ſtill one, in all of theſe functions, but acts under a diſtinct notion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is a neceſſity of the actuall improvement of his Kingly and Prophetick office, to bring men into a Juſtified ſtate; and to bring Juſtified ones to the end of their Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. There muſt be light to lead men to Chriſt, power to ſubdue men unto him, as well as a price paid to reconcile them. When the price of our redemtion is paid by Chriſt, and not publiſhed, it is like the hid treaſure, by which no man hath advantage: Yea, were it made known, and by faith appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and brought home, our enemies yet are ſo potent and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous that they would ſtill prevaile againſt us. Being redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a price out of the hands of the Fathers Juſtice, we muſt be reſcued by a power out of the hands of Sathan; When his right determines, (as it is with many unjuſt poſſeſſors) he will yet keep his hold.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Our faith hath reſpect to whole Chriſt, to every part and piece of his Mediatorſhip. It yeelds to his ſoveraignty, is gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by his counſell, and reſts in his attonement. So that the faith which Juſtifies looks at his Kingly office, at his Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick office, as well as at his Prieſtly office, but not as it juſtifies. <hi>Quà</hi> teaching, it looks upon him as a Prophet, and learns; <hi>Quà</hi> ruling, it looks upon him as a King, and ſubmits to him; <hi>Quà</hi> ſacrificing, and making atonement, it looks upon him as a Prieſt, and reſts there for acquitall and diſcharge. Where the Goſpel diſtinguiſhes, our faith is diſtinctly to act and look.</p>
                     <p>As to the charge laid againſt me, <hi>I</hi> ſhall ſay little. <hi>I</hi> had rather ſpeak for truth then for my ſelf. You tell me, <hi>that my expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions confound Chriſt and his actions, with mans faith in our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, or theſe two queſtions [by what we are Juſtified</hi> ex par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Chriſti] <hi>and [by what we are Juſtified</hi> ex parte noſtri.] For anſwer, <hi>I</hi> only leave it to the Readers eyes, whether I do not mention, [our faith] as diſtinct from [the blood of Chriſt] in the words by you recited; And it is faith by which we
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:168215:293"/> are Juſtified <hi>ex parte noſtri.</hi> The implyed ſenſe which you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, <hi>I</hi> ſhall further conſider in ſome expreſſe reaſons.</p>
                     <p>Now for your arguments, we have ten in number, and not above two of them conclude the propoſition in queſtion.</p>
                     <p>Your firſt concludes, <hi>That Chriſt is not received as Chriſt,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mr. Brs. Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> 
                        <hi>if not as Lord-Redeemer,</hi> which is a new phraſe, which <hi>I</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not, that I have read before <hi>I</hi> read this Apology. For Anſwer, <hi>I</hi> ſay Chriſt is to be received as the Lord our Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and as our Maſter or Teacher, but faith in Juſtification, eys Redemption, not Dominion.</p>
                     <p>Your ſecond concludes from the authority of the Aſſembly, <hi>That Juſtifying faith is the receiving of Chriſt, as he is offered in the Gopel; But he is offered in the Goſpel as Saviour and Lord.</hi> All which is that which never was denyed.</p>
                     <p>Your third concludes, <hi>That to ſave from the power of ſin, is as true a part of a Saviours office, as to ſave from the guilt,</hi> which is not at all to the queſtion. Saving from the power of Sin, Sanctifies, and not Juſtifies.</p>
                     <p>Your fourth, <hi>Of faiths receiving Chriſt, as he Juſtifies us,</hi> affirming, <hi>that he Juſtifies us, as King, &amp; Judge, and Benefactor,</hi> is the ſame, for ought <hi>I</hi> can diſcern, with your tenth, and there is to be conſidered.</p>
                     <p>Your fifth is, <hi>If receiving Chriſt as Satisfier and Meritor, be the only faith that gives right to Juſtification; then on the ſame grounds we muſt ſay, It is the only faith that gives right to further Sanctification and to Glorification.</hi> If you put this argument into form, the word <hi>[meritor]</hi> will be found aequivocall, and the Syllogiſm to conſiſt of four termes. We look at Chriſt for Juſtification, as ſatisfying Juſtice, and meriting pardon and remiſſion, not as meriting Sanctification.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly you ſay, <hi>Rejecting Chriſt as a King, is the condemning ſin, therefore receiving him as King, is the Juſtifying faith.</hi> This is like the old argument, Evill works merit condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Ergo</hi> good works merit ſalvation. An ill meaning damnes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.27. Our good meaning therefore ſaves. I further anſwer, Rejecting Chriſt as a King, is a ſin againſt the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Law, which damnes: Yet ſomewhat more then ſubjection to the Morall Law is required, that a ſinner may be ſaved. You give in your reaſon of your conſequent, <hi>Becauſe unbelief, ſay you, condemneth, (at leaſt partly) as it is the privation of the
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:168215:294"/> Juſtifying Faith; explaining your ſelf, that you ſpeak of that condemnation, or peremptory ſentence, which is proper to the New Law.</hi> To this I anſwer, Unbelief, if we ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, doth not at all condemne, further then as it is a breach of a Morall Commandment. The privation, of which you ſpeak, only holds the ſentence of the Law in force and power againſt us: which me thinks ſhould be your judgment as well as mine, ſeeing you are wont to compare the New Law (as you call it) to an Act of Oblivion, And an Act of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion ſaves many, but condemnes none: If a Traytor, or Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer be exempted in any ſuch Act of Oblivion, it is their crime that condemnes them, only the Act provides no remedy for them. It harmes them not, only it does not help them.

                     <p>Ninthly, you ſay, <hi>That faith which is the condition of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is the condition of Juſtification or remiſſion: But it is the receiving of Chriſt as King, as well as a ſatisfier, that is the condition of our ſalvation; Therfore, &amp;c. Anſw.</hi> Here the Concluſion is ſafely gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. You know that we yeeld, that the faith that accepts Chriſt as a King, Juſtifies: But that is not the Juſtifying act.

<pb n="565" facs="tcp:168215:294"/> phraſe) you yeeld ſufficiently, where you diſtinguiſh of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication begun, the condition whereof is faith only, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification conſummate, there you bring in Repentance and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; That which you call Juſtification begun, is Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion properly ſo called. Faith only is ſerviceable to reconcile us unto God; but there is more required for reparation of our quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, to hold us up in communion with God. Of this I have ſpoke, Chap. 1.2, 13, 14. of my treatiſe of the Covenant.</p>
                     <p>Your tenth and laſt reaſon is, <hi>If accepting Chriſt a Lord Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer be the</hi> fides quae Juſtificat, <hi>i. e.</hi> quae eſt conditio Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficationis, <hi>then it is meerly, ſtrictly, and properly the Juſtifying act of faith, as the accepting of Chriſts righteouſneſſe is: But the Antecedent</hi> (you ſay) <hi>is granted by all Divines that you have to do with:</hi> Therefore, &amp;c. <hi>Anſw.</hi> If they grant your Antecedent ſimply, as in this phraſe you deliver it, I much marvell. This ſeemes to imply that Chriſt acted <hi>quà</hi> Lord, in paying the price of our Redemption: and that this work of his, is to be referred to his exaltation, and not to his ſtate of humiliation: And I am ſure the Scripture ſpeaks otherwiſe. That which I yeeld is, That the faith which accepts Chriſt who is our Lord and Redeemer, is the faith which Juſtifies, and the condition of our Juſtification; But as it lookes upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption a ſacrificing act of Prieſt-hood,<note place="margin">The diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>fides quae</hi> and <hi>fides quà,</hi> aſſerted.</note> done by him who is indeed a Lord and King, ſit only Juſtifies. But this diſtinction of <hi>Fides quae Juſtificat,</hi> and <hi>Fides quà Juſtificat,</hi> is (as you are pleas'd to ſay) <hi>the generall cheat,</hi> ſo that your Antecedent it ſeemes is granted you, by all thoſe Divines with whom you deal, under this limit; And as it ſeems, you have met with a pack of impoſtors, &amp; that of the moſt learned in the Land, that out of their great condeſcenſion, have written for your ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. This word, you think, ſounds harſhly from Mr. <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> as indeed it doth, and is no ſmall blemiſh to his great paines, you may then judge how it will take from your ſelf, in the ears of others: And I much marvell that this diſtinction, that every where elſe would paſſe, and be confeſſed to be of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, to avoid confuſion in thoſe diſtinct capacities, in which men uſually act, ſhould here not alone be queſtioned, but thus branded. Does not every man that undergoes various relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions variouſly act according to them? And do not men that make addreſſe, addreſſe themſelves in like variety? He that is
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:168215:295"/> at once, a Husband, a Parent, a Maſter, a School-maſter, a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, acts variouſly according to all of theſe capacities. Some come to him as a <hi>father,</hi> ſome as a <hi>Maſter,</hi> ſome as a <hi>Teacher,</hi> all of them come unto him, as a Phyſician; But only they that come to him, as a Phyſician, are cur'd by him. Believers through faith go to Chriſt, that bears all the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons mentioned; But as they ſeek ſatisfaction in his blood-ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, which is an act of his Prieſt-hood, they are juſtified. Learned <hi>Ameſius</hi> may worthily be rank'd in the firſt place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe that you thus honour. As ſoon as he enters up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the diſpute of juſtifying faith, in anſwer to <hi>Bellarmines</hi> firſt queſtion, <hi>What that faith is that is required to juſtification?</hi> he ſayes in the name of Proteſtants,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Hoc ipſum vel imperitè, vel ſophiſtice, in quaeſtionem vocatur.

Sect. 8. which <hi>I</hi> leave to the Reader to conſult at pleaſure. And together with it, that which may be ſeen largely in <hi>Chemniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> enquiring into the proper object of juſtifying faith, in his <hi>Examen Concil: Trident: mihi</hi> pag. 159. under this head, <hi>Quid ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rè &amp; propriè ſit fides juſtificans, &amp; quo ſenſu ſcriptura velit intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi, quando pronunciat impium fide juſtificari.</hi>

                     <p>I ſhall here take the boldneſs to give in my arguments to make good, that faith in Chriſt, <hi>quà</hi> Lord, doth not juſtifie.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That which the types under the Law, appointed for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement and expiation, lead us unto in Chriſt, our faith muſt eye for attonement, expiation, and reconciliation; This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied; Theſe Levitical types lead us doubtleſs to a right object, being School-maſters to lead us unto Chriſt, and ſhaddows whereof he is the ſubſtance; As alſo to that office in him (who is the object of faith) that ſerves for this work: But theſe types lead us unto Chriſt in his Prieſtly office, for the moſt part as Sacrificing, ſometimes as interceding, <hi>John</hi> 1.29. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. A great part of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is a proof of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="567" facs="tcp:168215:295"/>2. That which the Sacraments under the Goſpel, ſetting forth Chriſt for pardon of ſin, lead us unto, That our faith muſt eye, for Reconciliation, Pardon, and Juſtification; This is clear, Chriſt in his own inſtituted ordinances, will not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guide us: But theſe lead us to Chriſt ſuffering, dying for the pardon of ſin, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.28. <hi>This is my blood in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhed for you, and for many for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Here is a confirmation of both theſe arguments in one; The types of the Law, and the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, lead both of them to his blood, for this reaſon of attonement and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. There was an old Teſtament enjoyn'd of God, in which the people in convenant were ſprinkled with blood, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.1, &amp;c. commented upon by the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.20, &amp;c. That blood, and this cup, lead to Chriſts blood for forgiveneſs, and in them the death of Chriſt is remembred. A broken, bleeding, dying Chriſt, in the Lords Supper is received.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As the Spirit of God guides faith, ſo it muſt go to Chriſt for propitiation and attonement; This needs no proof; The Holy Ghoſt is the beſt leader: But the Holy Ghoſt guides our faith to go to the blood of Chriſt for attonement, <hi>whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood,</hi> Ro. 3.25. It is blood is our propitiatory or mercy ſeat: We are juſtified by his blood, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. And faith is our way of intereſt, and thither the Spirit of God, by the Apoſtle, leads our faith, as we ſee in the words mentioned. I am checkt indeed by you, becauſe I ſay, <hi>through faith in his blood, not faith in his command: quo jure neſcio,</hi> ſay you. My reaſon, or warranty is; becauſe I durſt not adde to the Apoſtles directory; when he leads us one way, I dare look no other. If he had intended to have led us to Chriſt as a propitiation, without further direction, under what notion our faith ſhould have look'd upon him; It had been enough to have ſaid, that he is our propitiation: but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly pointing out [his blood] and [faith in his blood] I think I have warrant ſufficient to lead ſouls hither, and only hither: eſpecially ſeeing I find him ſtill in the ſame language, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8, 9. <hi>God commendeth his love towards us, in that, while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt dyed for us, much more then, being now juſtified by his blood, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath, through him. In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveneſs of our ſins,</hi> Epheſ. 1.7. <hi>The blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:168215:296"/> from all ſin,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. <hi>For as much as ye know that we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed —with the precious blood of Chriſt, as a Lamb without blemiſh.</hi> You demand, <hi>Will you exclude his obedience, reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, interceſſion?</hi> To which I only ſay, I marvail at the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; If I exclude theſe, I ſhall exclude his blood; His ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of blood was in obedience, <hi>John</hi> 10.18. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. His reſurrection was his freedom from the bonds of death, and an evidence of our diſcharge by blood: His interceſſion is founded on his blood; He intercedes, not as we, by bare petition, but merit: He preſents his blood as our high Prieſt in the holy of holies. You tell me further, that the thing I had to prove, was not the excluſion of [faith in his commands] but of [faith in Chriſt as Lord and teacher.] I can no more diſtinguiſh [Lord] and [command] then I can [blood] and [ſacrifice] it being the office of a Lord to rule, as of blood to make attonement. You yet tell me, <hi>It was fitteſt for</hi> Paul <hi>to ſay [by faith in his blood] becauſe he intends to connote both what we are juſtified by,</hi> ex parte Chriſti, <hi>and what we are juſtified by,</hi> ex parte noſtri, <hi>but the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer principally.</hi> To this I ſay, If this were fitteſt for <hi>Paul,</hi> then it is unfit for any to come in with animadverſions, and tell us of any other thing, either <hi>ex parte Chriſti,</hi> or <hi>ex parte noſtri,</hi> for ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification. I pray you reſt here, and we are well agreed. Here is Chriſts Prieſtly office on his part alone, and I am reſolved to look no further.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Our faith muſt look upon Chriſt ſo as to obtain righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs by him, by vertue of which we may appear before God as righteous: But it is by his obedience as a Servant, that we obtain righteouſneſs, and ſtand before the Lord as righteous, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.19. <hi>By the obedience of one, many are made righteous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. That way that Chriſt took to bring us to God, our faith muſt eye and follow: But Chriſt by death, the ſacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, brings us to God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Chriſt alſo hath once ſuffered for ſins, the juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. As Chriſt frees us from the curſe, ſo he juſtifies us, and in that notion our faith muſt look unto him for juſtification. This is plain; Juſtification being no other but our acquittall from the curſe, which is the ſentence of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Acts 13.38. But Chriſt frees us from the curſe, in ſuffering as a ſacrifice, not ruling as a Lord, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us: for it is written, Curſed is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that hangeth on a tree.</hi>

                     <p>I ſaid in my Treatiſe of the Covenants, [there are ſeverall acts of juſtifying ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. but thoſe are not acts of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. It is not <hi>Abrahams</hi> obedience, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſelf-denyal, <hi>Gideons</hi> or <hi>Sampſons</hi> valour, that was their juſtification, but his blood that did enable them in thoſe duties by his Spirit; <hi>Paul</hi> went in theſe duties as high as they; and I doubt not, but he overtopt them; yet he was not thereby juſtified.] Here are many exceptions taken. 1. At the phraſe [an act of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on] with much ado made to know my meaning, when I had thought all had well enough underſtood it: You would fancy that I mean that juſtification it ſelf acts, ſpeaking of it, not as an object, but an efficient; but I muſt acquaint you, that it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that juſtification acts, when I ſpeak of the acts of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as it doth, that harveſt works, when I ſpeak of harveſt-work.

Anſw.</hi> And ſhould the Apoſtle have then ſaid that they were done by faith? Is not this his error, as the former is mine? I pray you what was that [work of faith] that the Apoſtle mentions, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.3? Faith wrought and acted ſomewhat. 4. You demand, <hi>what mean you to ſay, obedience and valour was not their juſtification?

                        <pb n="570" facs="tcp:168215:297"/> which is as much as, it was his juſtification. That which is a prevalent plea in any Court to obtain juſtification, is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly called juſtification.

Your fifth and ſixth need not to have been put into two; <hi>Then how come you to ſay next,</hi> (ſay you) <hi>that it is Chriſt's blood? The blood of Chriſt is the meritorious cauſe of our juſtification, &amp;c. But I thought the conteſt in your diſpute had been, which is the juſtifying act of faith, and which not?

And thus then the Apoſtle argues; God onely is Judge to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie: But my innocency, or integrity is not God: Therefore it doth not juſtifie. It ſeemes that <hi>Abrahams</hi> works with you are God, for you tell us preſently that he was juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by them. The Apoſtle indeed addes, in the following words, <hi>He that judgeth me is the Lord;</hi> But thoſe words have not refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to theſe now in hand, as is plain in the context, but to that which he had ſpoken to verſ. 3. <hi>With me it is a very ſmall thing that I ſhould be judged of you, or of mans Judgment, yea I judge not mine own ſelf,</hi> to which theſe words come in direct oppoſition, <hi>But he that judgeth me is the Lord.</hi> And thus then the Apoſtle here argues, He that muſt ſtand to the Judgment of the Lord, may account it a very ſmall thing to be judged of men: But I muſt ſtand to the Judgment of the Lord: <hi>Ergo.</hi> I think the Reader may find a better interpretation of this text from Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> quoted by me in this treatiſe, which might be ſeconded by the authority of ſeverall others, and ſuch (as he ſayth) renders the text ſtrong againſt Juſtification by works. When you have expounded the words as you have done, they ſerve to ſhut out all works, in which <hi>Paul</hi> ever appear'd, from Juſtification. There followes ſuch an inference that you would hardly bear with from another. <hi>Can you hence prove</hi> (ſay you) <hi>that accepting Chriſt as a Lord is not the condition of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then you may prove the ſame of the accepting of him as a Saviour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It ſeemes every word in a whole treatiſe muſt immediatly of it ſelf, formally prove the main thing that is in queſtion. It proves that works parallel to <hi>Abrahams</hi> offering <hi>Iſaack,</hi> or lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of his Country, are none ſuch whereby men are juſtified. It fully proves that which the next words ſeems to diſprove.</p>

                     <p>I brought in by way of objection that text of [<hi>James,</hi> and endeavoured to give ſome anſwer to it:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>James</hi> 2 24. vindicated.</note> 
                        <hi>James</hi> indeed ſaith, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was Juſtified by works, when he had offered <hi>Iſaack</hi> his Son on the Altar, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.21. But either there we muſt underſtand a working faith, with <hi>Piſator, Paraeus,</hi> and <hi>Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and confeſs that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James</hi> handle two diſtinct que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, The one, whether faith alone Juſtifies without works? which he concludes in the affirmative; The other, what faith Juſtifies? Whether a working faith only, and not a faith that is dead and idle? Or elſe I know not how to make ſenſe of the Apoſtle, who ſtreight infers from <hi>Abrahams</hi> Juſtification by the offer of his Son, And the Scripture was fulfilled which ſaith, <hi>Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousneſſe.</hi> How otherwiſe do theſe aceord? He was Juſtified by works, and the Scripture was fulfilled which ſaith, he was Juſtified by faith?] Here are many exceptions taken, <hi>If</hi> James <hi>muſt uſe the term [works] twelve times in thirteen verſes, a thing not uſuall, as if he had fore-ſeen how men would queſtion his meaning, and yet for all that we muſt believe, that by [works]</hi> James <hi>doth not mean [works] it would prove as hard a thing to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Scripture, as the</hi> Papiſts <hi>would perſwade us that it is. Anſw.</hi> Firſt, it ſeemes the difficulty of interpretation is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, when the word is uſed 12 times ſo near together, otherwiſe I doubt not but your ſelf wil confeſſe a neceſſity of interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this kind, which yet you would be loath to have branded with ſuch abſurdity. Secondly, If I durſt take the liberty that others aſſume, the doubt were eaſily ſolved, and ſay, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of a <hi>reall</hi> Juſtification, <hi>James</hi> of an <hi>equivocall,</hi> which interpretation would far better ſuit here then elſe where. A dead faith is fit to work a dead Juſtification, and ſuch as carries as full reſemblance to Juſtification in truth, as a dead corps doth of a living man. Thirdly, were you to interpret that of <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 22.6. <hi>I am a worm and no man,</hi> I think you would ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret it, as to make him a man and no worm. But to leave Metaphors,<note place="margin">Metonymies frequent in Scripture.</note> and come to the Metonymies of this kind. How frequently are ſuch found in Scripture? which inforce us to ſay, that not to be in ſtrict Propriety of ſpeech, what Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſaies, is.

                           <hi>Paul</hi> excludes not only works of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but all works, from Juſtification.</note> 
                        <hi>(ſuppoſing time) but the works that</hi> Paul <hi>ſpeaks of, no man muſt endeavour, or once imagine that he can perform,</hi> viz. <hi>ſuch as make the reward to be of debt, and not of grace.</hi> To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, 1. That if <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks only of meritorious works, then according to you, he ſpeaks of no works at all, for there are none ſuch, no not in Angels, <hi>Confeſs.

He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude then works to which a reward is due, <hi>vi promiſſi,</hi> rather then <hi>meriti,</hi> As <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. he excludes boaſting of works done by the help of grace: for there is a matter of boaſting in theſe, as we ſee in the <hi>Phariſee,</hi> Luk. 18.11. 2. If <hi>Paul</hi> had here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of works of merit, and I muſt believe him, ſo elſewhere he ſpeaks of other works, and there both you and I are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him likewiſe. 1. He ſpeaks and excludes all the works that we have done, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. Which he univerſally oppoſes to Juſtification by free grace, v. 7. and it is of faith, that it may be of grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. 2. He ſpeaks of and excludes all thoſe works, or that righteouſneſſe, which is not the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of God by faith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 8.8, 9. that is, all the righteouſneſs that is inherent in us, and not in Chriſt alone, and made ours by faith: therefore he is called the Lord <hi>our Righteouſneſſe,</hi> Jer.
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:168215:299"/> 23.6. and ſaid to be made of God unto <hi>us righteouſneſſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. 3. He ſpeaks of, and excludes, all thoſe works which the Law commands, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. Now there is no work of grace but the Law gives it in charge, yea the Law commands to take in grace, whereſoever there is a tender of it, for our aſſiſtance, Requiring a duty, it requires all neceſſary helps to it. And therefore <hi>Chemnitius</hi> obſerves, that when the Apoſtle excludes the works of the Law from Juſtification, his intention is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the higheſt and nobleſt, not only done by <hi>Phariſees</hi> or unregenerate perſons, but <hi>Abraham, David,</hi> or the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent convents. 4. He ſpeaks of and excludes all thoſe works, that any man in the higheſt pitch of grace can attain unto, in the place quoted, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>I know nothing by my ſelf, yet I am not thereby Juſtified.</hi> He knew no matter of condemnation ſay you, <hi>ſenſu Evangelico,</hi> he then kept up to that which God in the Goſpel-Covenant calls for: And yet he is not thereby juſtified. Though God will not condemne a man of that integrity, through grace, yet this doth not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. <hi>This place,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Cartwright</hi> on the words) <hi>is the death of your Juſtification by works. For if</hi> Paul <hi>knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by himſelf (in that wherein the Corinthians might ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him moſt guilty) and was not ſo much as in that point Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before God, who is he that dares to Juſtifie himſelf before God in any work?</hi> And <hi>Fulk</hi> on the words. <hi>Paul doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that he is not Juſtified by his faithfull ſervice, and labour in the Goſpel, therefore no man can be Juſtified by his works done of grace, in as great perfection as can be done of mortall man.</hi> If the whole diſcharge of <hi>Paules</hi> miniſteriall function, wherein he took heed to himſelf and to his doctrines, was not ſuch where by he could be Juſtified, How then could <hi>Abraham</hi> be juſtified in offering <hi>Iſaack,</hi> or <hi>Rahab</hi> in her hiding of the ſpies? If the Apoſtle therefore do exclude works of merit, we ſee what works he alſo excludes with it. You futher ſay, Paul <hi>ſpeaks indeed of faith collaterally, but of Chriſts merits and free grace, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and purpoſely: So that the chief part of</hi> Pauls <hi>controverſie was, Whether we are juſtified freely through Chriſts merits, or through our own meritorious works. But</hi> James <hi>queſtion is, Whether we are Juſtified by faith alone, or by faith with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience accompanying it, and both, as ſubordinate to Chriſts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.

                           <hi>Paul</hi> treats di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly of Juſtification by faith.</note> and ſo fully to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of faith in Juſtiſtification, but that his ſcope is no leſſe to ſhew what juſtifies <hi>ex parte noſtri,</hi> which it ſtill faith, then what that is that juſtifies <hi>ex parte Dei,</hi> which is grace, or <hi>ex parte Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti,</hi> which is his blood or merit? Pauls <hi>queſtion,</hi> you ſay <hi>is of the meritorious cauſe of our Juſtification,</hi> James <hi>his queſtion of the condition on our part.</hi> If you are in the right, <hi>Paul</hi> certainly was much defective in his Logick. We think the queſtion in debate is to be put into the Concluſion, &amp; ſee how he concludes <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. <hi>Therefore we conclude that a man is juſtified by faith without the works of the Law.</hi> Inferences are made, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſectaries drawn from that which is mainly in diſpute, and not from that which is collaterally mentioned, and upon the <hi>bie</hi> onely touched upon: Now he concludes from the doctrine of Juſtification by faith, mentioning as we ſee Juſtification <hi>ex parte noſtri,</hi> peace with God through our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 5.1. You further ſay, <hi>Paul ſpeaks of Juſtification</hi> in toto, <hi>both in the beginning and progreſſe, but eſpecially in the beginning, but</hi> James <hi>ſpeaks only of Juſtification as continued, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate, and not as begun, For both</hi> Abrahams, <hi>and every mans was begun, before works of obedience.</hi> I Anſwer, Then works do not conſummate; for <hi>Paul</hi> caſts off all works from this office, and he ſpeaks, according to you, of Juſtification <hi>in toto,</hi> and if <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of it only as conſummate, and finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, why does he inſtance in <hi>Rahab,</hi> this being the firſt that was heard of her being in faith or grace? The Authors that you follow are wont to ſay, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>firſt,</hi> and <hi>James</hi> of the <hi>ſecond Juſtification,</hi> and it had been more for your advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, fully to have followed them, then to have ſaid that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks principally of the firſt, yet ſpeaks of the ſecond likewiſe. Yet you may ſee how hardly thoſe of that opinion have been put to it. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that knows as well how to ſtickle for an opinion as another, ſays, that <hi>Paul ſpeaking of the firſt Juſticati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, fetches a proof from</hi> Abraham, <hi>which is underſtood of the ſecond Juſtification: and</hi> James <hi>ſpeaking of the ſecond Juſtification, fetches a proof from</hi> Rahab, <hi>which is the firſt Juſtification,</hi> which as long ſince I have obſerved, in the vindication of this text, agrees like harp and harrow. So that if the Authors that I follow
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:168215:300"/> have miſſed the meaning of theſe Apoſtles, thoſe that follow you, are much leſſe like to find it. Yet after all this labour, for a Reconciliation of this ſeeming difference between theſe great Apoſtles, the Reader ſtands much engaged for that which you have brought to light from Reverend Mr. <hi>Gatakers</hi> hand in his Letter written to you, where we ſee in what judgement he both liv'd and died, taking it up as (he ſaies) when he was a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and perſiſting in it to his laſt, wholly differing from you, and agreeing with me. <hi>In</hi> Paul <hi>the queſtion is</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>of ſin in generall, concerning which, when any man ſhall be therewith charged, there is no means whereby he may be juſtified, that is, juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſoyled from the otherwiſe juſt charge of being a ſinner, but by his faith in Chriſts blood: Chriſts blood having made ſatisfaction to Gods Juſtice for ſin, and his faith in it, giving him a right to it, and intereſt in it.</hi> This he underſtands of all ſin, through the whole courſe of a believers life; firſt and laſt, faith is his way of Juſtification; <hi>Whereas in James ſaith he, the queſtion is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſome ſpeciall ſin, and the queſtioned perſons guilt of it, or free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from it.</hi> What ſpeciall ſin he means, he explaines him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to wit, <hi>Whether a man be a true or counterfeit, believer, a ſound and ſincere, or a falſe and feigned profeſſor?</hi> In which caſe any perſon that is ſo wrongfully charged, may plead not guilty, and offer himſelf to be tryed by his works, as in ſome caſes Gods Saints have done, even with appeal to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And what differs this from what I ſay? onely the faith that is not counterfeit, but evidenced by works, juſtifies. The truth of his faith is queſtioned, whenſoever the ſincerity of his profeſſion is thus charged.

You take it for granted, and would perſwade your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that if <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe the word is once figurative, (where the proper acceptation is both deſtructive to the ſenſe, and repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the whole tenor of the Goſpel, which was my ſecond reaſon by you omitted) that I muſt therefore ſo interpret it all along. But you have had Scripture inſtances to the contrary, and are directed where you may be further furniſhed. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that when <hi>James</hi> affirms that faith without works is dead, and therefore cannot juſtifie, ad ſayes, <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified by works when he offered <hi>Iſaac,</hi> which Scripture ſays
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:168215:301"/> was a work of faith, of if that do not pleaſe, was done by faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.17. and further ſayes, that in his juſtification by works the Scripture was fulfill'd, which ſayes, he was juſtified by faith; Is it not a fair interpretation to underſtand <hi>a working faith;</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is alone of poſſible power to juſtifie, when the Scripture alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing this inſtanced juſtifying work of <hi>Abrham,</hi> to the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as we ſee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.17.</p>
                     <p>In the cloſe of your ten arguments you ſpeak your ſenſe of the danger which is like to follow upon this tenent; which I have thought moſt meet to reſerve to this place. <hi>What ſad effects,</hi> ſay you, <hi>it may produce, to teach the world, that the onely juſtifying act of faith, is, the accepting of juſtification as merited by Chriſts blood, or the accepting of Chriſts righteouſnes to juſtifie them, it is not hard for an unprejudic'd man to diſcern. For my part, in all my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the caſe of the ungodly that I have triall of, I can find no commoner cauſe of their generall deluſion and perdition, then this very doctrine. Anſw.</hi> To this I might have many things to ſay.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is the hard fate,<note place="margin">Deſperate Concluſions inferr'd from right princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</note> (if I may ſay ſo) of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to have inferences of this kind drawn from her principles. And yet the way of Chriſtians hath not been, either to deſert the principles from which they are drawn, nor yet to own or defend the inferences or concluſions that are drawn from them. The Apoſtle affirming that the exaltation of Gods glory, in not utterly caſting of the Nation of the Jewes, was eminently ſeen in their diſloyalty and covenant-breaking with him; Inference is preſently made, that covenant-breaking, and diſloyalty, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not then be blamed. <hi>If the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie to his glory: why yet am I alſo judged as a ſinner?</hi> That which advanceth Gods glory cannot be charged as a ſin, Bat covenant-breaking with God, (according to the Apoſtle) addes to his glory, and therefore it cannot be charged as a ſin: If anſwer be made, that this exaltation of God in his glory is by accident, and no thanks to him that breaks covenant, but to the goodneſs of God that brings good out of evill: From this, inference is made alſo, <hi>Let us then do evill that good may come,</hi> which Concluſion was ſlanderouſly charged upon the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. verſ. 8.

<pb n="580" facs="tcp:168215:302"/> then without reaſon finds a fault with his creature, this being his will, who can reſiſt it? <hi>Ro.</hi> 9.19. The wits of ſome have been indeed buſied to put ſuch a comment upon the Apoſtles words, that no ſuch inference as theſe, with any colour, or ſhew of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, can be drawn: and thereby make it appear that their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is utterly diſſonant from the Text; for from the Apoſtles doctrine, theſe inferences, in the judgement of blinded reaſon, and rules held between creature and creature, ſeem directly to follow, as evidently appears in the Apoſtles anſwer. To come nearer to the buſineſs in hand, the Apoſtle making it his work to advance Gods free grace in mans juſtification, ſome feared leſt their ſin was above the grace of a pardon: To ſatisfie theſe, the Apoſtle tels them, that where ſin abounded, grace doth ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-abound, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20. So that the greatneſs of their ſin exalts the free grace and favour of God: an inference is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ready, <hi>Let us then continue in ſin, that grace may abound,</hi> Rom. 6.1. And here indeed was as fair and full encouragement to ſin, as any that you hold out, in your objection againſt this doctrine; this very uſe which you ſay is now made by wicked ones, of this Doctrine, generally taught by Proteſtants, was made (as is ſaid) in the Apoſtles times, by the Gnoſticks and others, who maintained, that it was enough to believe that Chriſt died for ſin, though a man liv'd in all wickedneſs and ungodlineſs. How could this ſo ſoon ſpring in the Church, but that carnal ones found ſome-what that would bear ſome colour on which they might bottom it? as, <hi>omne mendacium fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datur in aliquâ veritate,</hi> as may be ſeen verified in the inſtances mentioned. Let not Chriſtian doctrin then be blamed upon the account of ſuch deſperate deductions, and curſedly wreſted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences. As ſoon as reformation began, and this doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others appeared, it is well known what from the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries it ſuffered. As it was laid to the Reformers charge, that they made <hi>God the author of ſin,</hi> ſo that <hi>Gibieuf</hi> with his black mouth, makes <hi>Calvin</hi> worſe then the <hi>Manichees:</hi> ſo alſo that they utterly laid aſide all care and regard of good works, or wayes of godlineſs, and that upon account of their doctrine, that <hi>faith alone juſtifies.</hi> It is well known with what a belly they uſe to picture <hi>Luther,</hi> as if his work had been alone to drink. And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> taking upon him in the preface to his fourth Tome, out of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> to ſet out what a creature a

<pb n="582" facs="tcp:168215:303"/> his requeſt, the ſaid</hi> Baſhaw <hi>anſwered, I ſee that you Calviniſts and we are like to be ſhortly one, Save only that leaving the drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of water to us, you willl keep your ſelves to wine, and be drunk with it.</hi> Charges of this nature, <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts</hi> were wont ſtill to hear, but divine providence, through grace, hath ſo ordered, that theſe Calumnies, as with a beam of the Sun, have been diſpelled. The holy lives of thoſe that appeared for this doctrine hath been an abundant reall comfutation. Not to look beyond the ſeas where we might be furniſhed with ſeverall inſtances, let <hi>Jewel, Grindall, Pilkington, Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds, Fulk, Whitaker, Perkins, Fox, Greenewood, Dod, Hilderſon, Pemble, Ball,</hi> and many others, with their Followers, witneſſe. In ſo much, that by degrees, ſhame hath cauſed them to forbear this Language. And as for thoſe who of latter times have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded from this doctrine of this ſuppoſed danger (as <hi>Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue</hi> and his followers, as may be ſeen in his <hi>Gagg,</hi> and <hi>Appeal</hi>) whether their lives and zeal for the Goſpel did at all outſtrip thoſe already mentioned, whoſe ſuppoſed errors in doctrine they went about to correct, I leave to all of impartiall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to witneſs. How great a trouble is it then to have this, by a man of your name and reputation, now revived? For that experience of yours, of which we have already heard, and you further enlarge,<note place="margin">The aſſertion (that faith in Chriſt's blood is the only juſtifying act) acquit from danger.</note> in your affirming that <hi>you never met with the moſt rebellious wretch (except now and then one under terrors) but when they have ſinn'd their worſt, they ſtill think to be ſaved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they believe; and what is their believing? why they believe that Chriſt died for them, and therefore God will forgive them, and they truſt for pardon and ſalvation from Chriſt's death and Gods mercy.</hi> To this I anſwer: Though I do not in any other thing appear in competition with you, yet here I may ſay, my experience hath been of a longer ſtanding then yours, yet I can ſay, it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers not that which you here mention. When I have to deal with ſuch that you name, if they look out of themſelves at all, it is uſually to Gods mercy. He is, ſay they, a mercifull God, and at what time ſoever a ſinner repenteth from the bottom of his heart, he is ready to receive, and ſo relying on Gods mercy, they will take their time for their return. Which is anſwered alſo, as is evident in the experience of others. Read Practical Treatiſes, and publiſh'd Sermons, and ſee whether this plea be not commonly ſpoken to: Ordinarily their anſwer is, that their
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:168215:303"/> good doings, their Prayers, and Repentance, muſt ſave them. Few comparatively will have Chriſt in their mouths, till he be put into their heads. And if they hit upon <hi>faith,</hi> as ſometimes they will, they yet know not how to terminate it on Chriſt's blood. It is only a good belief, that God will not deal ſo with them. Such a faith the Plain mans path-way to heaven, out of much experience of ſuch mens anſwers, doth notably decipher. It is a rare thing to meet with one that will argue as you would put it into their mouths, <hi>viz. He that hath the only juſtifying act of faith is juſtified: But that have I; For I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Chriſt to forgive and juſtifie me by his blood: Therefore I am juſtified.</hi> But in caſe any ſhall thus reaſon, you ſay you are not able to anſwer, and I ſhall not preſume to be your teacher. But me thinks you might deign to learn of Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> and tell ſuch a diſputant, that it is not every thing that bears the name of faith, that is an acceptation of Chriſt to juſtification. You may acquaint him, that there is a true and ſincere faith, and that there is a falſe and counterfeit faith; and that it is not enough for juſtification to ſay, that a man hath faith, but ſoundly and ſincerely to believe. If he ſay, that his faith is not diſſembled, but ſincere, put him upon that which Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> ſayes, is Saint <hi>James</hi> his way of tryall, If he will have faith to juſtifie his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, let works then juſtifie his faith. There is life in that faith that takes Chriſt's blood for juſtification, and that faith that hath life to take, hath life alſo to work. Where a receiving or taking faith is, there Chriſt is, and where Chriſt is, the ſoul can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens. So tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> if the man be ſuch as you ſpeak, his faith is caſt, at the firſt ſight, and evidenced to be no better then counterfeit, and is no <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> to juſtification. He may talk that Chriſt is his, but it is clear that it is on a crackt title: and his faith being no better then you ſay, had he all the Logick in the world, here he muſt be <hi>non pluſs'd.</hi> And here I would willingly learn how you will convince ſuch a man of whom you here ſpeak, upon your own principles. If he ſhall argue, He that hath the onely juſtifying act of faith is juſtified: but that have I; for I take Chriſt as my Saviour, and Soveraign Lord: <hi>Ergo.</hi> Seeing there are many that profeſs to take Chriſt for a Lord, as well as a Saviour, that muſt never enter into the kingdome of heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.21. If they do not ſpit at Chriſt and defie him, they perſwade themſelves
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:168215:304"/> that they ſerve him. A ſervice of Jeſus Chriſt, with their own moſt favourable and eaſie comment upon it, they doubt not will ſave them. And <hi>I</hi> know no viler perſons in the world, then thoſe that ſay, that they love and ſerve Chriſt with all their heart, and that their good works and ſerving of God muſt keep them from hell and damnation: As <hi>I</hi> once heard a man ſtark drunk on a Lords-day profeſs, that fall back, fall edge, he would never leave ſerving God whilſt he lived. Theſe, if they may be believed, have as good an heart to God, as he that is moſt preciſe in all the world. And if they be wanting in that acuteneſs of Logick that you before mention, they may be wel holpen, out of your principles, which they may find anon, thus to reaſon. He that fals ſhort of the precepts of the Law, and requiſites in the Goſpel, may yet be juſtified and ſaved, if he anſwers to the conditions of the Goſpel-covenant: But thus do <hi>I:</hi> although <hi>I</hi> come not is to the precepts of the Law, not to what is required in the Goſpel, yet <hi>I</hi> anſwer to the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it, for according to you, theſe come ſhort both of the commands of the Law, and the precepts of the Goſpell. Though they do not all that is commanded them neither in Law nor Goſpell, yet they hope they do that which will ſave them. They have their faults, they confeſs, and who, ſay they, is free? Few dayes paſs over their heads, but they ſay, God forgive me. What you ſay is their wickedneſs, they will ſay is innocent and praiſe worthy; I never knew a more vile wretch then one that would ſay, that he thought in conſcience he ſerved God better on a <hi>Sunday,</hi> ſpending ſix pence in an Ale-houſe to help a poor woman with her children to live, then in going to Church, when his own wife and children ſtood in a much need, as any Ale-wive's whoſoever. Look among Papiſts, who look upon works, not only as ſuch that juſtifie, but alſo merit, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogate, and ſee how far they exceed thoſe that hold this, which you call ſo dangerous a principle. They are Saints here, they ſay, compar'd with thoſe in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> this being the place of their perſecution: Yet Doctor <hi>Hall</hi> obſerves in his ſerious diſſwaſive from Popery, that he never yet could know that Papiſt, which made conſcience of all Gods ten morall Lawes: ſo that in leaving our principles to chooſe theirs, upon a deſign to advance good works, you much miſtake your way, and go about to work with a wrong engine. And I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:168215:304"/> no other, but that theſe inferences are without reaſon, and that there is no Goſpel-principle that can be laid down, but men may alike wreſt to their own perdition.</p>

Having touched upon divers paſſages of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> This is added, <hi>In the aforeſaid places the Apoſtle toucheth eſpecially three things which muſt go together in our Juſtifycation, upon Gods part, his great mercy and grace; upon Chriſts part, Juſtice, that is, the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Gods Juſtice, or the price of our Redemtion, by the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his body, &amp; ſhedding of his blood, with the fulfilling of the Law perfectly and throughly; and upon our part, true and lively faith in the merits of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt — <hi>And therefore Saint</hi> Paul <hi>declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth here nothing upon the behalf of man, concerning his Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but only a true and lively faith. And yet that faith doth not ſhut out repentance, hope, love, dread, and the fear of God to be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſaith in every man that is Juſtified, but it ſhutteth them out from the office of Juſtifying,</hi> With much more to the ſame purpoſe. Your Readers that are not ſo much ſeen in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and <hi>Suarez,</hi> as they are in the Scriptures,
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:168215:306"/> or at leaſt, that do not ſo much heed them, deny all that you take for granted. In which alſo you have phraſes more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth to your Readers, then any that I have uttered can be to you; <hi>to be righteous ſignifieth,</hi> ſay you, <hi>quoad legem novam, non obligatus ad poenam, &amp; cui debetur praemium.</hi> This ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, according to this new law, I think was never found in any of our old and new Dictionaries. Thoſe that are righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſhall be thus acquit, and rewarded, we believe, but not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on account of any righteouſneſſe inherent in them, but the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Chriſt made theirs by faith: and ſo their faith is accounted to them for righteouſneſſe. You then adde, <hi>So that you ſee that your firſt righteouſneſſe [non reatus poenae, vel jus ad impunitatem &amp; ad praemium] as it requires Chriſts perfect ſatisfaction as a</hi> medium <hi>to it, by which all the charge of the Law works muſt be anſwered; So it requires our performance of the condition of the Law of grace, as an other</hi> medium, <hi>by which Chriſt and his benefits are made ours.</hi> I had thought that our righteouſneſſe had not been <hi>non reatus poenae</hi> that is not the thing, at beſt, were it as perfect as <hi>Adams</hi> was, but reather <hi>non reatus culpae.</hi> If a man be charged with Murther, his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe as to this charge, is, his not-killing, and not his non-obligation to the Gibbet, That follows upon it; <hi>non reatus,</hi> is not of the eſſence of righteouſneſſe, nor is <hi>reatus</hi> of the eſſence of ſin, otherwiſe then <hi>conſecutive.</hi> And that Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe ſhould be thus called a <hi>medium,</hi> I do not ſee. I think it is the thing it ſelf, and not a <hi>medium</hi> to it. And that our righteouſneſſe is any <hi>medium</hi> to Juſtification as it is inherent, I deny: and that our inherent righteouſneſſe required by the Law of Grace, ſtands in any ſuch ſubordination to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Chriſt, as a neceſſary means to make it ours, I ſee your word for it, but I think (and the reformed Churches are of the ſame mind) that I have the whole current of Scripture againſt it. You cloſe up this diſcourſe thus; <hi>And thus I have done what at preſent I thought my duty, that it might be not my fault, that you are in ignorance all over; But I have ſaid the leſſe, becauſe I have lately more exactly opened the nature of our righteouſneſſe, in anſwer to the Animadverſions of an other learned brother.</hi> But it is worth inquiry whether this learned Brother have received ſatisfaction from that more exact paines of yours. Perhaps his learning may ſerve to give as exact an anſwer. And if his greater
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:168215:306"/> learning be not ſatisfyed, with that which is more exact and ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate, my leſs learning may well remain as much unſatisfied with leſſe exactneſſe. And your Reader will think you were not ſo well adviſed, to publiſh your ſelf, and conceal your moſt exact opening of this poynt of ſo great concernement. Though you might think, that any thing might ſerve me, yet all your exactneſſe will, I believe, be litte enough in this poynt to give ſatisfaction to many Readers.</p>
                     <p>Whereas you had ſaid in your Aphoriſmes, <hi>pag.</hi> 122. <hi>Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righteouſneſſe, is not righteouſneſſe, but unrighteouſneſſe.</hi>

By a way of conceſſion, <hi>that holineſſe is taken, firſt, for the relation of a perſon or thing dedicated to God, So it admits not of</hi> magìs <hi>and</hi> minùs <hi>more then righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi> 2. <hi>That the common uſe of the word, Holineſſe, is for the qualities or actions of a ſpiritually-renewed man,</hi> &amp; this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to have its <hi>tranſcendent perfection, as wel as righteouſneſs.</hi> Hitherto we are agreed; <hi>but here,</hi> ſay you, <hi>is the difference, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe thus taken is a quality, which though it have the truth of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet it is intendend and remitted or doth</hi> recipere <hi>magìs &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nùs righteouſnes is a relation which in</hi> ſuo formali <hi>is not intended or remitted.</hi> And is not Righteouſneſſe a quality in like manner, which is intended and remitted? when <hi>Zachary</hi> ſaies,<note place="margin">Righteouſneſs as well as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</note> 
                        <hi>We are delivered out of the hands of all our enemies, to ſerve in righteouſneſse and true holineſſe,</hi> Is not the one a qualification by a new work of the Spirit, as well as the other? When the Angel ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. <hi>He that is unjuſt, let him be unjuſt ſtill; and he that is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill; and he that is righteous, let him be righteous ſtill; and he that is holy, let him be holy ſtill:</hi> As [unjuſt] and [filthy] hold out vicious qualities from the fleſh, ſo [Holy] and [righteous] both ſignifie renewed qualities by the Spirit. It follows, <hi>Nay if you will exactly open it, it will appear that the righteouſneſſe in queſtion is a relation founded in a relation. Yea more, that the very</hi> ſubjectum proximum hujus relationis nec intenditur, nec remittitur, <hi>&amp; this is that I mean by perfection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the aforeſaid tranſcendentall perfection.</hi> And how ſhall we know what the righteouſnes in queſtion is? either it muſt be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of your own words, or out of their words, that you
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:168215:307"/> cenſure as guilty of ſuch ignorance, as before; Let us look upon your own words, <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.2. which you there comment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>In this fore-explained ſenſe, it is that men in Scripture,</hi> (ſay you) <hi>are ſaid to be perſonally righteous: And in this ſenſe it is, that the faith and duties of believers, are ſaid to pleaſe God,</hi> viz. <hi>as they are related to the covenant of Grace, and not as they are mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd by the Covenant of works.</hi> Are not [faith] and [duties] here our perſonall righteouſneſſe? and is not [faith] a branch of holineſſe as well as it is of righteouſneſſe? And hath it not its degrees as well as righteouſneſs? Surely the Apoſtles thought ſo when they prayed, <hi>Lord increaſe our faith,</hi> Luk. 17.5. And the Lord Chriſt had no other thoughts, when he rebukes his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for their <hi>little faith,</hi> Matth. 6.30. And commends the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Canaan</hi> for the <hi>greatneſſe of her faith,</hi> Matth. 15.28. And as it riſeth and falls, ſo do other duties with it: they are more intenſe, or remiſſe, in like manner. And as for their ſpeeches which you challenge; do you think that their ignorance was in that meaſure intolerable, as to believe the righteouſneſſe of what they ſpake was a meer non-entity, <hi>i.e.</hi> had nothing of the being of righteouſneſſe in it? They doubtleſſe looked upon righteouſneſſe as a renewed quality, as you do upon holineſſe, and the Apoſtle, both upon <hi>holineſſe</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> Eph. 4.24. The new man is ſo put on that we muſt be ſtill putting it on. It follows, that ſeeing <hi>theſe things are</hi> exactioris indiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis, <hi>underſtand that the reaſon of my aſſertion lyes here: The law as it is the rule of obedience, doth require perfect obedience in degree, and ſo here is an imperfection in our actions in the degree, as being ſhort of what the rule requireth, and it being theſe actions with their habits which we call our holineſſe, therefore we muſt needs ſay, our holineſſe is imperfect. And if our righteouſneſse were to be denominated from this law, commanding perfection, we muſt ſay, not that ſuch righteouſneſſe were imperfect, becauſe the holineſſe or obedience is imperfect, but it is none at all, becauſe they are imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> It ſeems you intend here, exactneſſe equall to that in which you appeared to the learned brother before mentioned; and as you did diſtinguiſh before of a <hi>metaphyſicall</hi> and <hi>morall</hi> perfection, ſo you ſeem here to diſtinguiſh of righteouſneſſe and holineſſe: either as a <hi>duty</hi> performed by men in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace according to rule; or elſe as a <hi>condition</hi> required by the Covenant of works, reſpective to the attainment of life
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:168215:307"/> upon terms there required. This ſeems to be your meaning in your laſt words in this Paragraph: <hi>Duty ſimply as duty, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs or ſupernaturall grace as ſuch may be more or leſs; But holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and duty, as the</hi> materia requiſita, vel ſubjectum proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum juſtitiae, conſiſtit in indiviſibili. How duty and holineſs can be the ſubject of it ſelf, I know not; for ſo they are, if they be the ſubjects of righteouſneſs. That righteouſneſs in which we muſt exceed the righteouſneſs of Scribes and Phariſees is our duty, and our holineſs as well as of our righteouſneſs; but if you carry it thence to make it the righteouſneſs of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, it is eaſily granted, that the imperfection of it, renders it as no righteouſneſs reſpective to that end of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life by it. A Phariſee might as well be juſtified upon the terms of that covenant, as <hi>Noah, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Job, Zachary,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> or any other of thoſe, that were moſt perfect and eminent in righteouſneſs. But I think, no Reader could obſerve either in your own words, or theirs that you cenſure, any ſuch meaning.</p>
                     <p>To aſſert the imperfection of our righteouſneſs <hi>I</hi> ſaid, [<hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah, I</hi> am ſure, ſaith, All our righteouſneſſes are as filthy rags, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 64.6. no greater charge of imperfection can lie againſt the moſt imperfect holineſs, then the Prophet layes upon our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, Interpreting the Prophets words, as <hi>I</hi> think the ſenſe of them is generally given by interpreters ancient and modern. But ſeeing you go off to ſpeak of righteouſneſs of another kind, <hi>I</hi> will not contend. <hi>I</hi> there added, [Neither do <hi>I</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how holineſs ſhould be imperfect, taken materially, and righteouſneſs perfect, taken formally in reference to a rule.] After ſuch courteous cenſure that you pleaſe to give, you fall to examine what that is, that <hi>I</hi> underſtand not. In which you take one piece of my ſentence apart, and ſay, [How holineſs ſhould be imperfect, taken materially,] <hi>ſure you underſtand that. It is therefore,</hi> ſay you, <hi>no doubt, the other branch that you mean, How righteouſneſs is perfect taken formally in reference to a rule.</hi> If the Reader pleaſe to conſult my words, he may ſee that <hi>I</hi> put them not <hi>diviſim,</hi> but <hi>conjunctim,</hi> giving in my reaſon, why to me it is non-intelligible, telling you that [we may for ought <hi>I</hi> know, as well make holineſs <hi>formall,</hi> and refer it to a rule, and righteouſneſs <hi>materiall,</hi> in an abſolute conſideration, without reference to any rule at all.] This you disjoyn from the reſt,
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:168215:308"/> and fall upon my words apart; for what reaſon, is beſt known to your ſelf; And <hi>I</hi> leave it to the Reader to judge, whether that <hi>I</hi> may not call holineſs perfect, and righteouſneſs imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as well as you may call righteouſneſs perfect, and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs imperfect; and whether there is not a materiality, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, (not in the one, or the other)) but in the one, as well as the other: and this was that which <hi>I</hi> ſpake to. And any man that underſtands no more then <hi>I,</hi> will (<hi>I</hi> think) take this to be a material exception againſt that which in your Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſmes was delivered. You ſay, <hi>if you, or any man reſolve to uſe holineſs in the ſame ſenſe as righteouſneſs, if I once know your minds, I will not contradict you, for I find no pleaſure in contending about Words, but for my ſelf, I muſt uſe them in the common ſenſe, if I will be underſtood.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Righteouſneſs and holineſs in what ſenſe commonly uſed.</note> But you might have done well to let us know that, that is the common ſenſe of the word <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> (taken for perſonall inherent righteouſneſs) which you here uſe; till <hi>I</hi> ſee that made good, <hi>I</hi> ſhall judge it to be your own peculiar acceptation of it. <hi>I</hi> would know what interpreter of <hi>Zachary's</hi> words, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.75. of <hi>Paul's</hi> words, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.24. of <hi>John's</hi> words, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.11. do put ſuch a difference as you make between <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> &amp; <hi>holineſs,</hi> as to make one a renewed quality of the Spirit, the other no ſuch thing, but a relation <hi>in eſſe formali,</hi> to what you muſt explain your ſelf; I have read ſo much difference indeed made, as to put holineſs for duties of the firſt Table, in immediate reference to God; righteouſneſs for duties of the ſecond Table, in immediate concernment to man: but thus taken, they are both equally new qualities from the Spirit, and have their intenſion and remiſſion, one, as well as the other. And I have read a rule given, that where they are put together (as in the Scriptures quoted) they are to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed as before, but where the one is put apart, it is to be underſtood as comprehenſive of both. It were eaſie to ſhew, that writers of moſt eminent name promiſcuouſly uſe theſe terms of righteouſneſs and holineſs. But for your interpretation, for ought I know, you are alone in it, ſpeaking as you do, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituling your diſcourſe of perſonal inherent righteouſneſs. I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,<note place="margin">Moral perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection is in reference to a rule.</note> [And in ſuch conſideration, (<hi>viz.</hi> without any reference to any rule at all) I do not know how there can be perfection, or imperfection, (either in holineſs, or righteouſneſs: Is is as it they come up to,) or fall ſhort of the rule, that they have the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:168215:308"/> of perfection, or imperfection.] To this you ſay, <hi>At the firſt view the ſentence ſeem'd ſo ſtrange to me, that I thought it meeteſt to ſay nothing, becauſe it is ſcarce capable of any apt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, but what will ſeem ſharp, or unmannerly:</hi> Now you have found out a way to ſpeak, both mildly and mannerly, you think, (it ſeems) that your words will be more heeded, then at other times. You further ſay, <hi>That which I ſay you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, is ſomething, or nothing: if ſomething, and yet not capable of perfection, or imperfection, it is ſuch a ſomething, as the world ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of till now.</hi> I had thought, on the contrary, that there is many a thing in the world, (&amp; I believe ſhall think, when you have ſpoke all that you can againſt it) capable neither of morall perfection, or imperfection, and of ſuch perfection we ſpeak, when we ſpeak of inherent perſonall righteouſneſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uncapable either of perfection, or imperfection, becauſe there is no rule by which they are meaſured. The Schoolmen, you know, ſpeak of actions preventing reaſon, which they ſay are actions <hi>of men,</hi> but deny them properly to be actions <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi> as you may ſee in <hi>Thom.</hi> 1, 2. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 1. <hi>art.</hi> 1, 2. as to move the foot, rub the beard, when a mans thoughts are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent on ſomewhat elſe. Theſe, they uſe to ſay have neither rectitude, nor irrectitude in them, are neither good, nor evil, and therefore neither perfect, nor imperfect. But if all actions of men muſt be alſo humane, and ſuch that reaſon orders, ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cording to rule, or at leaſt ought to order, and are therefore ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther right or oblique, as ſome in oppoſition to Schoolmen do determine; yet doubtleſs it is not ſo in the actions of brute creatures: Theſe have neither morall perfection, nor imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſeeing they act by no rule, ſave that of natures inſtinct. And if all rule were taken from man, his actions would be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel. Where there is no Law, there is no tranſgreſſion, and conſequently no conformity, nor inconformity, no rectitude, nor irrectitude, and ſo neither perfection, nor imperfection. You adde, <hi>But upon ſecond thoughts, I find that your words,</hi> de juſtitiâ <hi>may be born, for it is nothing that you ſpeak of.</hi> This I think is ſuch an anſwer, that few will ſee either mildneſs, or manners in it.

That which follows, muſt at leaſt be repeated: <hi>But that holineſs taken for ſprituall habits and acts, can have neither perfection or imperfection; or that, that they are capable of no perfection, or imperfection, in any other ſenſe, but as related; nor yet in relations to God, or the perſon dedicating, ſave only in relation to the Rule; all theſe for the firſt reaſon, ſhall have no anſwer but a recitall.</hi> I might ſay of much that is here repeated, <hi>Tu male dum repetis, incipit eſſe tuus.</hi> And I think that which you now repeat, is not ſuch that you may ſay, <hi>magnâ fronte recit-âſſe, eſt refutaſſe.</hi> To this ſupercilious reply, I only ſay; that this is the firſt time that ever I heard of holineſs of <hi>ſeparation, dedication,</hi> or <hi>relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> applied to acts, or habits of this nature. And what elſe, but the reference to the rule, can denominate them imperfect, I would you had ſpoke out.

And if you have often ſaid, that there is ſuch a twofold rule, <hi>I</hi> think no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, but your ſelf, hath ſaid it, and <hi>I</hi> neither hear of Scripture, nor reaſon for it. We are ſpeaking of <hi>agenda,</hi> and not <hi>credenda;</hi> and that here ſhould be any rule <hi>de a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendis,</hi> but the precept determining of duty, or that the promiſe,<note place="margin">There is a righteouſneſs, in an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Law.</note> or any act that goes along with the promiſe (which what it means, <hi>I</hi> cannot imagine) ſhould be any rule of our actions, <hi>I</hi> never heard, but from your mouth. And for your inference, <hi>That all our Actions and Habits, comming ſhort of the precept, determining of duty, no man therefore hath a righteouſneſs conſiſting in this conformity, I</hi> ſhould think, all but your ſelf, would take to be a <hi>Non ſequitur.</hi> There is a righteouſneſs in conformity to the precept, which yet fals ſhort of a full and perfect conformity. Look <hi>I</hi> pray you upon <hi>Zacharie,</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth;</hi> that have this praiſe in the Goſpel, that <hi>they were both righteous before God,</hi> and by what rule this righteouſneſs had its denomination, let the Text be conſulted. If <hi>walking in all the ordinances,</hi> and <hi>commandements of God blameleſs,</hi> give men the denomination of righteouſneſs, then there is a righteouſneſs in conformity to the precept? But walking in all the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ordinances of God, denominates men righteous; <hi>Ergo,</hi> doing righteouſneſs denominates righteous; <hi>He that

                     <p>I added in my Treatiſe, [Whereas a charge of ignorance is laid even upon learned Teachers, that commonly underſtand the word [Righteouſneſs] and [Righteous] as it refers to the old Rule, I profeſs my ſelf to have little of their learning, but I am wholly theirs in this ignorance. I know no other Rule, but the old Rule, the Rule of the Moral Law, that is with me a Rule, a perfect Rule, and the only Rule.] Here you firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of want of candor in me in not repeating all that you ſpoke, and if is but this once, that I know, that <hi>I</hi> am thus charged: And the ſenſe, <hi>I</hi> think, is full in thoſe words that <hi>I</hi> do ſet down. Secondly, you go about to clear your ſelf from ſome aſperſions, concerning harſh ſpeeches uſed by you againſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Divines: in which, you ſay, you ſpeak not to me, but to others, ſtanding thus charged by them, and not by me. In which <hi>I</hi> am well content that you ſhould ſtand as right in your
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:168215:310"/> Readers eyes as you can deſire, and ſhall forbear to rake fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into that ulcer. Thirdly, you take me to task, and are content to put my name at length, <hi>As for</hi> Mr. <hi>Blake's profeſſion, that he hath little of their learning, but is wholly theirs in this ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, I did ſtill think otherwiſe of him, and durſt not to have deſcrib'd him: But yet my acquaintance with him is not ſo great, as that I ſhould pretend to know him, better then he knows himſelf, and I dare not judge, but he ſpeaks as he thinks.</hi> Good Sir, ſay it over again, that it may be known from an hand of your emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence; that I ſay, my learning is little; and that I ſpeak it, not more modeſtly, then truly, neither do you know, how much <hi>I</hi> ſuffer, that it is no more. Yet, leaſt the cauſe in which I appear ſhould ſuffer with me, or rather in me, let me aſſume ſo much boldneſſe, as to tell you, that <hi>I</hi> yet think, that, that little which through grace <hi>I</hi> have obtained, may ſerve to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thoſe arguments, which this piece of yours holds forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me. <hi>I</hi> have been often confounded with your multitude, but never perceived my ſelf ſhatter'd by your ſtrength; not that my learning is equall with yours, (<hi>I</hi> know my ſelf better, then to enter ſuch compariſons) but your cauſe is unequall to mine. Your advantage is not ſo great againſt me in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of your abilities, as mine againſt you in the goodneſſe of the cauſe. It would often go ill with a good cauſe if the moſt able Advocates ſhould not ſometimes be worſted, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of impartiall Judges. Should you and <hi>I</hi> make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, So that <hi>I</hi> were to appear in the cauſe that you main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and you in that which <hi>I</hi> defend, a weaker then you, would eaſily do that, which <hi>I</hi> think you have not yet done. But your willingneſſe is obſervable to take a hint from my mouth, to ſtrip me of all the learning of theſe learned men, charged with intolerable ignorance; and leave their ignorance only with me, as the whole you are willing to allow me. Yet in the next place you engage me to you in your endeavours to help me out of my ignorance in this. <hi>Let me be hold to ſhew him,</hi> (ſay you) <hi>part of that, which he ſayth he is wholly ignorant of: That our perſonall inherent Righteouſneſſe is not denominated from the old Law, or Covenant, as if we were called righteous (beſides our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Righteouſneſs) only becauſe our Sanctification, and good works have ſome imperfect agreement to the Law of works.</hi> But I were ignorant indeed, if you could ſurprize me with your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:168215:311"/> of theſe terms, [Law] and [Covenant.] Thoſe two I take much to differ. In your Aphoriſms, (where you think you ſpeak moſt full, and here complain, that <hi>I</hi> omitted ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of that which you there ſaid) you have the word [Law] and the word [Rule:] But <hi>I</hi> hear not of the word [Covenant] at all. But here, <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi> are confounded, as though every Law were a Covenant, and every Covenant a Law. And <hi>I</hi> were yet more in ignorance, if <hi>I</hi> ſhould let your Syllogiſms paſs, as you have laid them down. The firſt of your ſeven is, <hi>If no man be called Righteous by the Law of works, but he that perfectly obeyeth, (ſo as never to ſin) then no imperfect obeyer is called Righteous</hi> (niſi aequivocè) <hi>by that Lawy: But the Antecedent is true; Therefore ſo is the conſequent.</hi> Here <hi>I</hi> would deſire that you would explain your ſelf, in what ſenſe any Law can call any particular man Righteous? The Law laies down generall Rules, and makes not particular application to this, or that perſon. If you mean that no man hath the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a righteous, or juſt perſon, upon his obſervation of the precepts of the Law, you muſt except <hi>Zachary,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and all other which in Scripture have the title of juſt, or righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. <hi>I</hi> pray you conſult <hi>Calvin</hi> on Luke 1.6.<note n="(o)" place="margin">Neque e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim eſt haec de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitio negligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, juſtos eſſe, qui vitam ſuam formant ad le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis praecepta.

                     <p>IN the next place, you take me up for ſaying, [I know no other Rule but the old Rule, the Rule of the Morall Law, that is with me a Rule, a perfect Rule, and the only Rule:] And make it your buſineſſe to Catechize me better: And thereupon you ſay, <hi>diſtinguendum eſt.</hi> And ſo we have a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of diſtinctions, (too many to write out) with this Elogy] upon them: <hi>I think the ſolidity and great neceſſity of all theſe diſtinctions is beyond diſpute.</hi> But I confeſſe, I cannot be induced to be of your mind.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Brs.</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs'd.</note> I think the ſolidity of ſome of them may well be diſputed; and the neceſſity of moſt of them (as to our buſineſſe) wholy denyed. I am to ſeek, how the
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:168215:312"/> preceptive part of the Law of nature, <hi>delivered to</hi> Moſes, and the preceptive part of the Law of nature, <hi>now uſed by Chriſt,</hi> as his own Law, (which is one of your diſtinctions) do differ. Whether Chriſt and <hi>Moſes,</hi> in holding out a Law of nature, ſtand at any ſuch diſtance, may at leaſt be diſputed, though perhaps, when others ſee it not, you may be able to conclude it. I as yet neither know, any detraction from, or addition to, the preceptive part of the Law of nature by Chriſt. I think there was neither any abolition, addition, or diminution reſpective to the Law thus conſidered, made by our Saviour. I do not yet ſee reaſon ſo much as to recede from that opinion, that this Law, as delivered by <hi>Moſes,</hi> is binding to Chriſtians. If you be able to conclude the negative, yet I know, that as it hath been, ſo it may be ſtill diſputed. And when we are ſpeaking of the rule of <hi>Righteouſneſſe</hi> or obedience, which is the line and thread according to which our actions ſhould be ſquared, (under which you juſtly comprehend the prohibition as <hi>proeceptum de non agendis</hi>) I ſee no neceſſity of talking either of a rule of <hi>reward,</hi> or <hi>puniſhment,</hi> or a rule of the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the reward, or puniſhment;</hi> which is another of your diſtinctions. Theſe three laſt Rules, if they be true Rules, may here, as to this buſineſſe, be very well over-ruled. They are not at all eſſentiall to a Law, as comming neither within the direction for duty, nor obligation to duty, but only ſerve <hi>ad bene eſſe,</hi> to quicken our obedience, and to withold from tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. As to the [Promiſe] God might have commanded us to work, and never have told us of any pay, and, The [Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment] is upon ſuppoſall of fayling in duty. And if you thus bring them in, as acceſſary parts of the Law, yet I ſee no i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable reaſon to ſpeak of them as Rules, unleſſe it be ſuch as God hath propoſed to himſelf, in his way of diſtributive Juſtice. They can be no Rule to us, determining only, (as your ſelf obſerve) what ſhall be done to us, not what ſhall be done by us. The firſt branch then of your fourfold diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Rule is here alone of uſeful conſideration, that is, the Rule of Obedience, or what ſhall be due from us. We have nothing to ſay here either of the Rule of Reward, or Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor of the Rule of the condition of the Reward, or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, which are your other branches. And that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I here intended; and I had thought, all I would have
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:168215:312"/> known that I only intended it. This you ſay, you ſuppoſe is my meaning, as well you might: but withall you ſay, <hi>It is ſtrange to your ears; and give your reaſons.</hi> 1. <hi>That is but part of that very Law of nature. Doth not the Law of nature</hi> (ſay you) <hi>as well as the Poſitive Law determine</hi> de debito poenae, <hi>as well as</hi> de debito officii? But ſure <hi>debitum officii,</hi> and not <hi>debitum poenae,</hi> is our Rule. 2. You ſay, <hi>If you took it for the whole of nature, is that the only Rule?</hi> And here comes in, it ſeems, that which is ſtrange to your ears; that I ſhould make the Moral Law, as determining <hi>de debito officii,</hi> our only Rule, perfect and compleat: Which aſſertion being ſo unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly received, might well have delivered you from all wonder at the ſtrangeneſſe of it,<note place="margin">With whom they joyn that oppoſe the perfection of the Morall Law.</note> how erroneous ſoever you had judged it. Undertaking the negative part, and implead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it of imperfection, you have indeed <hi>Arminians, Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> on your part. But <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (for ought I know) unanimouſly your adverſaries. <hi>Papiſts</hi> have their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions added as well to the Law, as to the Goſpel, which is an accuſation of the written Law, as imperfect: They have alſo their Evangelicall Counſels, which though they are not commanded, yet (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſpeaks) are commended, as raiſing Chriſtians to an higher perfection, then ever the Law required. <hi>Socinians</hi> (with whom many <hi>Arminians</hi> joyn) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that Chriſt hath inſtituted new precepts of Obedience in the Goſpel; and added them to the Commands of the Law, ſuch as tranſcend and exceed all that were delivered in Old Teſtament-times. <hi>Gerrard</hi> having diſputed for the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law againſt <hi>Papiſts,</hi> cap. 14. <hi>De Evangelio,</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Popiſh opinion of New Laws promulgated by Chriſt, the</hi> Photinians (which is an other name of <hi>Socinians) greedily imbrace; mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a fair way for</hi> Mahometiſm, <hi>ſeeing that in the</hi> Alcoran <hi>it is in like manner ſaid, That</hi> Moſes <hi>gave a Law, leſſe perfect,</hi> Chriſt <hi>more perfect, and</hi> Mahomet <hi>moſt perfect of all.</hi> Out of the <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covian</hi> Catechiſm in the ſame Chapter, <hi>Gerrard</hi> quotes this paſſage, <hi>Chriſt came not only to fulfill the Law for us, but added new precepts to it. Theſe new precepts,</hi> (the ſame Author ſaith) <hi>they make twofold: Some of which do appertain to manners, Some to ceremonies, or outward rites in worſhip.</hi> He names three that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to manners: <hi>To deny a mans ſelf; take up his Croſſe; and follow Chriſt:</hi> Which three precepts my Author in way of
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:168215:313"/> oppoſition ſaith, <hi>belong to the firſt Commandement. Peltius</hi> in his Harmony of <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> Chap. 4, 4, 6. ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their combination againſt the Orthodox party, as in many other things, ſo in this propoſition now controverted. He there quotes from <hi>Socinians</hi> theſe poſitions: <hi>That Chriſt in the New Teſtament did not only abrogate the Ceremoniall and Judiciall Law, but did much increaſe and add unto the Morall Law: That he came not to deſtroy the Law, but to fulfil it; which fulfilling,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is nothing elſe but a perfecting of it, and addition of what was wanting: That we ought not only to obſerve thoſe things that are given to us of God, and not abrogated by Chrijſt, but thoſe precepts in like manner that are added by Chriſt.</hi> Much more from many <hi>Socinians,</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> may be ſeen in that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to that purpoſe. Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in his Practicall Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme, ſpeaking of Chriſts Sermon in the Mount, agrees in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed with the <hi>Papiſts</hi> againſt the <hi>Proteſtants, That Chriſt doth not here expound</hi> Moſes, <hi>and vindicate the Law from falſe gloſſes, but that he addes to the Law,</hi> and names many additions to the 6. &amp; 7.

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. If the Law be not a fully perfect and compleat Rule of our lives, then there is ſome ſin againſt God which is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the Law, this is clear; Deviation from any rule given of God is a ſin; Deviation from that ſuppoſed additionall rule is a ſin: But there is no ſin which the Law doth not condemn; <hi>Sin is a Tranſgreſſion of the Law,</hi> 1 John 3, 4. He that ſins, tranſgreſſeth the Law.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="604" facs="tcp:168215:314"/>2. If the Law alone diſcovers and makes ſin known, then it is a perfect, full, and compleat Rule; this is plain: <hi>Omne rectum index eſt obliqui.</hi> But the Law alone diſcovers ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. This office is aſcribed there to the Law, and is no other but the Morall Law. Had not the light of that Rule guided him in this work, he had never made any ſuch diſcovery. And it is the moral Law written in the decalogue that he means, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the quotation; <hi>I had not known luſt, except the Law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not covet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. That which alone works wrath is the alone Rule and guide of our lives. This is clear, in what ſence ſoever it is, that we take working of wrath: whether we underſtand it of working of wrath in man againſt God, as ſome do; Mans heart being apt to riſe againſt him that will exerciſe Soveraignty over him. Or of the wrath of God kindled againſt man upon tranſgreſſion of the Law. But it is the Law that works wrath: it is aſcribed to it, and it alone, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.15.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That which being removed will take away all poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſinning, that is alone, the Rule of our obedience: This is plain; were there any Rule, the tranſgreſſion of it would be ſtill our ſin. But the Law being removed, all poſſibility of ſin is taken away: <hi>Where there is no Law, there is no tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,</hi> Rom. 4 15.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. If the Law only adds ſtrength to ſin, <hi>viz.</hi> for condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then the Law is the alone Rule of obedience: This is plain; Any other Rule whatſoever addes like ſtrength to ſin, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tranſgreſſion will condemne. But the Law only addes ſtrength to ſin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56. <hi>The ſtrength of ſin is the Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. Either the epithite <hi>[morall]</hi> is not juſtly given to the Law, or elſe it is a perfect Rule of manners, that is, of obedience: This is plain; for <hi>morall</hi> denotes, as <hi>Ameſius</hi> obſerves, that uſe of it. But this epithite given to the Law, and appropriated to it, was never (as I think) upon any ſuch account challenged. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. Either this new Rule doth tranſcend the old Rule of the Morall Law, requiring a more exact degree of perfection (as <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſpeak of their Evangelicall counſels, &amp; <hi>Socinians</hi> of their additionall Goſpell precepts) or elſe it falls ſhort and admits of obedience in a degree more low. If it require obedience more high, then even the doers of the Law, in the greateſt highth and poſſible ſuppoſed perfection; though equall to the Angels, are
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:168215:314"/> ſinners: The Law might be fulfilled, and yet diſobedience charged. If it fall ſhort of the old Rule (which it ſeems is your opinion, ſeeing you confeſſe an imperfection is our perſonall righteouſneſſe, as it refers to the old Rule; and aſſert a perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as it relates to the new Rule) then the new Rule allows that which the old Rule condemnes, and ſo you bring in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepency between them, and find an allowance for tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. So that I think, I have ſufficient authority, divine and humane, with reaſons that are cogent, to conclude that which I have aſſerted, That the old Rule, the Rule of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law, is a perfect Rule, and the only Rule.</p>
                     <p>You come in here with ſix ſeveral exceptions taken againſt the<note n="(a)" place="margin">Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons taken againſt the perfection of the Law.</note> perfection of this Law, or ſingularity of it, as rule.</p>

For further clearing of this point, we muſt conſider of the preceptive part of the Moral Law, which alone in this place, is our buſineſs to enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, 1. As it is <hi>epitomized</hi> in the Decalogue, thoſe <hi>ten words,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> cals them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.28. or elſe, us <hi>commented upon,</hi> or more amply delivered in the whole Book of the Law, Prophets, and Scriptures of the New Teſtament. 2. We muſt diſtinguiſh of the manner how the Law preſcribes, or commands any thing as duty, which is either <hi>expreſly,</hi> or <hi>Synecdochically,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>directly,</hi> or elſe <hi>interpretatively, virtually, and reductively;</hi>
                        <pb n="606" facs="tcp:168215:315"/> I very well know, that the Law is not in all particulars ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely, and expreſly delivered, but that, 1. The uſe and beſt improvement of Reaſon is required to know, what <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc</hi> is called for at our hands for duty. The Law lays down rules in affirmative precepts, in an indefinite way, which we muſt bring home by particular application, diſcerning by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Scripture Rules, with the help of reaſon (which ſometimes is not ſo eaſie to be done) when it ſpeaks to us in a way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, as to preſent practicall obſervation. 2. That hints of providence are to be obſerved, to know what in preſent is duty, as to the affirmative part of the commandments of God. If that man, that fell among theeves, between <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Jericho,</hi> had ſate by the way, on the green graſs, without an appearance of harm, or preſent need of help, the Samaritane that paſſed that way, had not offended, in caſe he had taken no more notice, then the Prieſt &amp; Levite did: But diſcerning him in that caſe as he then was, the ſixt commandment called for that, which he then did, as a preſent office of love to his neighbour, according to the interpretation of this command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given by our Saviour, <hi>Mark.</hi> 3.4. When the Phariſees watched him, whether he would heal the man with the withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hand on the Sabbath day, He demands of them, Is it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to do good on the Sabbath day, or to do evill, To ſave life, or to deſtroy? It was not their mind, that Chriſt ſhould kill the man, onely they would not have had him then to have cur'd him: but not to cure, when it is in our power, according to Chriſt's interpretation, is to kill. If diligent obſervation be not then made, the commandment may be ſoon tranſgreſs'd. 3. Skill in Sciences, and profeſſions, is to be improved by men of skill, that the commandment may be kept. The Samaritane powred Wine and Oyl into the Samaritans wounds, knowing that to be of uſe, to ſupple and refreſh them: Had he known any other thing more ſoveraign, which might have been had, at hand, he was to have uſed it. As skill in Medicines is to be uſed for preſervation of mens lives, ſo alſo skill in the Laws, by thoſe that are vers'd in them, for the help of their neighbour, in exigents concerning his eſtate and livelihood. 4. We muſt liſten to Gods mouth, to learn when he ſhall be pleaſed at any time, further to manifeſt his mind, for the clearing of our way in any of his precepts. There was a command, concerning
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:168215:315"/> the place of publique, and ſolemn worſhip, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.5. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the place which the Lord your God ſhall chooſe out of all your tribes to put his name there, even to his habitation ſhall ye ſeek, and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhalt thou come.</hi> Now they muſt depend on the mouth of God, to obſerve what place in any of the Tribes he would chooſe for his habitation. When God commands, that all inſtituted worſhip ſhall be according to his preſcript; this is a perfect Rule implicite, and virtual, tying us to heed the Lord at any time, more particularly diſcovering his will, and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this duty to us. Was not the Law of worſhip, perfect to <hi>Abraham,</hi> unleſs it explicitely told him that he muſt ſacrifice his Son? And if you take your ſelf to be ſo acute, as to ſet up a new Rule, as you are pleaſed to ſtile it, then you antiquate and aboliſh the old Rule, and ſingularly gratifie the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomian party. Two Rules will no more ſtand together then two Covenants: In that you ſay a new Rule, you make the firſt old: Now that which decayeth and waxeth old, is <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to vaniſh away,</hi> Heb. 8.13. You adde moreover, doth not the Scripture call Chriſt our Law-giver, and ſay, The Law ſhall go out of <hi>Zion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 2.3. And was not I pray you the old Law, (as you are pleaſed to call it) his? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> I am ſure quotes that which belongs to the preceptive part of the Moral Law, and calls it the <hi>Law of Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 6.2. His Laws were delivered in the wilderneſs, whom the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> there tempted and provoked; This is plain, for they ſinn'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Law-giver, and from his hands they ſuffered. And who they tempted in the wilderneſs, ſee from the Apoſtles hand, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.9. And as to your Scripture, the words quoted are exegetically ſet down in thoſe that follow them. <hi>The Law ſhall go out of</hi> Zion, <hi>and the word of the Lord out of</hi> Jeruſalem: Which is no more, but that the name of the Lord, which was then known in <hi>Judah,</hi> ſhal be great from the riſing of the ſun, to the going down thereof. You further demand, <hi>And is he not the anointed King of the Church, and therefore hath legiſlative power?</hi> For anſwer, I deſire to know what King the Church had when the old Law was, before Chriſt came in the fleſh? the Kingdome was one &amp; the ſame, &amp; the King one and the ſame then, and now, as I take it. <hi>Many ſhall come from the Eaſt, &amp; Weſt, &amp; ſhall ſit down with</hi> Abrah. Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>in the kingdom of heaven.</hi> The Gentiles comming in at the Goſpel-call, are under
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:168215:316"/> the ſame King, and in the ſame Kingdome. And if all this were granted you for which you here plead, it is no more then a change in ſome poſitive, circumſtantial Rites, and what is this to our queſtion, That our righteouſneſſe, which is imperfect according to the old Rule, can be perfect according to the new? when old and new in that which is naturally Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, is ever one and the ſame. When the Law required heart-ſervice, and love with the whole heart, upon ſpiritual ends and motives, upon which account all fell ſhort in their obedience, and performance, ſhall we ſay that Chriſt did diſpenſe with any of this? ſo the Rule being lower, our obedience now may anſwer. Others that make <hi>Moſes</hi> and Chriſt two diſtinct Law-givers and agents for God, in holding out diſtinct precepts, give the pre-eminence to Chriſt, and account his Law to be of more eminent perfection. You on the contrary ſeem to make the Laws of Chriſt to ſtoop far beneath thoſe of <hi>Moſes.</hi>

For Juſtification of your accuſation of the Moral Law of imperfection, you ſay, <hi>I think the Moral Law, taken either for the Law given to</hi> Adam, <hi>or written in tables of ſtone, is not a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Rule for us now, for believing in Jeſus Chriſt, no nor the ſame Law of nature as ſtill in force under Chriſt.

                     <p n="5">5. I ſay, there was power in <hi>Adam,</hi> for that <hi>faith that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi>

<pb n="610" facs="tcp:168215:317"/> ſpeak of them as meer precepts, and ſo they are our Rule of righteouſneſs, and not as they are conditions either of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works or grace: And a man may be denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted righteous by the Laws Rule, when he cannot ſtand before the ſentence of it as a Covenant, of which we have heard ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. After a long diſcourſe againſt all poſſibilitie of Juſtification by the Law of works (as though I were therein your adverſarie, or that the <hi>Antinomian</hi> fancy were above all anſwer, that a man cannot make the Law his Rule, but he makes it withall his Juſtification) you go about to prevent an objection and ſay, <hi>If you ſhould ſay, this is the Covenant and not the Law,</hi> you then tell me that you will reply, 1. <hi>Then the Law is not the only Rule.</hi> To which I ſay, When my work is to make it good, that the Law is our only Rule, I marvaile that you will ſo much as imagine that I will ſay that which makes it not the only Rule. But perhaps, you think I do not ſee, how it cannot follow, as indeed I do not, neither can I ſee any colour for it. 2. You reply, <hi>It is the ſame thing in ſeverall reſpects, that we call a Law and a Covenant (except you mean it of our Covenant-act to God, of which we ſpeak not) who knowes not that</hi> praemiare <hi>and</hi> punire <hi>are Acts of a Law? And that an Act of Obliviom or generall pardon on certain terms is a Law, and that the promiſe is the principall part of the Law of Grace.</hi> To which I ſay, that <hi>praemiare</hi> and <hi>punire</hi> are not eſſentiall in a Law. Some have power of command, ſo that their words in juſt things is to be a Law, where moſt deny any power of puniſhment; as an Husband over the Wife. Some Parents have Authority to command Children, (Children remaining under the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fifth Commandment as long as the relation of a Child continueth) when they have neither power to reward or puniſh. <hi>Jacob</hi> took himſelf to be in power to command <hi>Joſeph</hi> (among the reſt of his Sons, as appears in the charge that he gives concerning his buriall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 47.29, 30. and Chap. 49.29. So compared) and yet he was not in power either to reward or puniſh him.

[Violation,]</hi> You ſay, <hi>is taken, either rigidly for one that in judgement is eſteemed a non-performer of the condition, or laxly, for one that in judgement is found a true performer of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but did neglect, or refuſe the performance for a time.</hi> You apply both theſe diſtinctions: <hi>Taking the word Covenant in the latter ſenſe,</hi> you ſay that you <hi>have affirmed, that man breaks ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a Covenant with God: yea even the Baptiſmal vow it ſelf, is ſo broken, till men do truly repent, and believe.</hi> To which I reply, That it is no other then the Baptiſmall vow, or Covenant, that we are to enquire into. Baptiſme is, as Circumciſion was, a ſeal of the Covenant: In Baptiſme then we engage to the terms of the Covenant, and till we repent and believe, by your own confeſſion, we break this Covenant. <hi>But taking the word [Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant]</hi> ſay you, <hi>in the former ſenſe,</hi> i. e. <hi>for Gods precepts, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:168215:324"/> and threatnings, and [<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iolation] in the latter ſenſe, for one that in Judgment</hi> (that is at the day of Judgment) <hi>is eſteemed a non performer of the conditions,</hi> ſo, you ſay, <hi>None violate the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant but finall <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers and impenitent, that is,</hi> (as you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine it) <hi>No other are the proper ſubject of its peremptory curſe or threatning.</hi> But Good Sir, reflect upon this explanation of yours, and in a more ſerious way, yet conſider of it. To help your ſelf out; you refer <hi>mans violation</hi> of Covenant, not to his own <hi>promiſe or engagement,</hi> in which he ſtands in duty tyed, but to <hi>Gods engagements,</hi> containing his promiſes and threatnings, and to violate Gods promiſe or threatning, (which you here im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plye to be done by Covenant-breakers) ſcarce carries ſenſe with it. We may incur his threatning, or miſſe of his promiſe; but we do not violate either his promiſe or threatning. Violation of Gods precept is diſobedience, of which <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> a man never in Covenant, was guilty, but no violation or breach of Covenant, where there is no voluntary engagement. Our engagement is neceſſity to make it up into a Covenant, and our violation of our engagements, to make it a breach of Covenant. Was ever any charged with breach of Covenant, in breaking not his own, but the condition of the other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting party? <hi>Jſrael</hi> was under a Law to let their <hi>Hebrew.</hi> Servants go free, the ſeaventh year, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.2. In <hi>Zedekiah's</hi> time, they ſerv'd themſelves of them beyond that terme. Here was the tranſgreſſion of a Law, but no breach of any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Covenant. But when they entred Covenant with God to do that which Law required, and ratified it by cutting a Calfe in twaine, paſſing through the parts of it; and again, ſerved themſelves of them; here was a breach of Covenant.</p>
                     <p>So that the violation that you ſpeak of (if you may call it a violation) is no Covenant-violation. Every man that breaks a Covenant, breaks his own; and not anothers part, in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
                     <p>And whereas you will have that to be a violation of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, laxly, and not rigidly taken,<note place="margin">Impenitent perſons in the moſt ſtrict and proper ſenſe are Covenant-breakers.</note> wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, Such a one, in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, is a man guilty of breach of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant during ſuch time of his neglect or refuſall. Was not that younger Son of his Father, mentioned <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. properly and in the moſt rigid ſenſe, a prodigal, when he waſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And was not ſhee alſo that was a ſinner in the City, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. truly a ſinner, or only in a laxe ſenſe, becauſe ſhe afterwards repented? Was not the penitent Thief, as truly, and in as rigid a ſenſe, a Thief, when he ſtole, as he that ſtole and repented not? And ſo he that lives in breach of promiſe with God, is as truly a breaker of Covenant, notwithſtanding following Repentance, as thoſe that live and die impenitent. I know therefore, no other way of explanation of your ſelf to your Readers ſatisfaction, but to ſay, that the Covenant of grace is not finally violated unleſſe the conditions be finally broke. Who ever doubted, but when a ſinner repents, the doom which is paſſed againſt him for ſin, is reverſt? And that <hi>Paul</hi> a perſecutor, not in a laxe, but in rigid ſenſe, afterwards building the faith that he deſtroyed, ſhall not appear in Judgment as a perſecutor. And ſo he that is, as truly and in no laxe ſenſe, a Covenant-breaker, being by grace brought in to keep Covenant in the day of Judgment ſhall be reputed and eſteemed a man faithful in Covenant.</p>

So farr as I have looked into the Author, I ſee him a man of much mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and one in whome reaſon is not wanting, though I will not undertake to declare either with, or againſt him.

You give in your reaſon, 1. <hi>That I have not diſproved the abſolute promiſe of the firſt ſpeciall Grace.

Theſe ſuppoſed promiſes, as you ſay in your anſwer, are not within the proper conditionall Covenant, and therefore I had nothing to do with it. 2. You further ſay, <hi>that I have not diſproved God to be the Author of our faith, ſo as that it is his work. Anſw.</hi> I do not find that in all your anſwer, and you moſt unfairely make the title of this Section, to be <hi>[Whether Faith and Repentance are Gods works]</hi> My buſinſſe was againſt your Queriſt, affirming them to be Gods conditions not ours. 3.

This is cleare; Being there expreſly required of us, and not ſo much as mentioned, as from God; they cannot be his engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but ours to performe. But Faith and Repentance are not mentioned as from God, in the proper conditionall Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but required of God from us. This propoſition is your
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:168215:329"/> own in your anſwer, as we have heard before, <hi>pag.</hi> 45, 46. Therefore Faith and Repentance are not God's conditions in the proper conditionall Covenant, but ours.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The conditions of a Covenant are his that performeth, and not his that impoſeth. This Propoſition is your own in this Section, and clear in reaſon. But we perform, and God impoſeth Faith and Repentance. This is of two parts; Firſt, that they are performed by us, This you confeſs, where you yield that they are our acts. For the ſecond, that they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on us, none can deny, See 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.23. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.30. They are therefore our conditions, and not God's, in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Covenant-conditions are theirs, that are charg'd with falſhood in caſe of failing in them, and non-performance of them. This is plain in all Covenants: To make conditions, and to fail in them, is to be falſe to them. But in caſe of fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in Faith and Repentance, man is charged and not God. God fails not but man deals falſly. Therefore they are mans conditions, and not Gods.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Covenant-conditions are theirs, who upon failing in them, and not performance of them, ſuffer as Covenant-brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers. This is clear. <hi>Iſrael</hi> covenanted to diſmiſs their He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew ſervants, and diſmiſſed them not: And <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſuffered for it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 34. But upon failing in Faith and Repentance, God ſuffers not, ſo much as in his name. He is not charged with mens unbelief and impenitence: Men themſelves ſuffer. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Faith and Repentance are mans conditions, not God's. So that though I have not refuted your anſwer, which never was in my eye, yet I have anſwered your Queriſt's demand, and made it good, that Faith and Repentance are mans conditions, and not God's, in the Goſpel-covenant.</p>

<pb n="636" facs="tcp:168215:330"/> though I had thought there had been a full accord between us. Now I muſt come to that in which we do agree, which pag. 144. Sect. 82. you entitle, <hi>[Whether the Covenant of Grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire perfection, and accept ſincerity?]</hi> In which <hi>I</hi> take to the negative, conceiving that it requires the ſame that it accepts. And in your Aphoriſmes, if <hi>I</hi> underſtand any thing, you have clearly delivered your ſelf with me, pag. 157, 158. in theſe words: <hi>As when the old Covenant ſaid, Thou ſhalt obey perfectly, the Moral Law did partly (I</hi> think you mean perfectly) <hi>tell them wherein they ſhould obey: So when the new Covenant ſaith, Thou ſhalt obey ſincerely, the Moral Law doth perfectly tell us wherein, or what we muſt endeavour to do, &amp;c.</hi> Whereupon Mr. <hi>Crandon</hi> is, herein againſt you, with as great vehemence as in any other of your doctrines. Neither do <hi>I</hi> perceive, by any thing that you have ſaid, that your mind is changed: And <hi>I</hi> had much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anſwer Mr. <hi>Crandon</hi> in defence of truth, which he, in you, here oppoſeth, then to ſpend time in my own quarrel. Though my Tenent give you not diſtaſt, yet it ſeems, my arguments do not pleaſe. But if truth ſtand, it matters leſs though <hi>I</hi> fall. You anſwer all my arguments in order, as though you judged me to be in the fowleſt error; when <hi>I</hi> am yet perſwaded, that if not onely ſome, but all of my arguments fail, which you make your buſineſs to impugn, the Poſition it ſelf, (which with you is truth, as well as with me) will fall with it. After a ſhort Apology, and conjecture made, who that Divine may be, whom with much reverence <hi>I</hi> mention, ſuppoſing him the firſt that manifeſted himſelf in the contrary way, that the Goſpel requires perfection, and accepts ſincerity, You tell me, that you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this difference is occaſioned by the ambiguity of the word [Covenant of Grace:] and tell me, that in your judgement, <hi>I ought to have removed it, by diſtinguiſhing, before I had argued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their opinion.</hi> And ſo you fall upon my work for me, and give in abundance of acceptations of the word [Covenant of Grace.] And if <hi>I</hi> may take the boldneſs to be as free with you, as you with me, <hi>I</hi> think you might have done well to have made it appear, where, and by whom, this word is taken in all of theſe different ſenſes, and ſignifications. If your Reader knew all this, before your Book fell into his hand, you have nothing benefited him, you have only told him what he knew before: If he he knew it not, he hath now
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:168215:330"/> alone your word for it. And <hi>I</hi> know not where elſe, any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may find a great part of it, but from your hand. <hi>I</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs my ſelf to be much more amazed then edified in Reading all that you have ſpoke of it. When you have reckoned up very many ſenſes of the word, you ſay, Now if the queſtion be, whether in any of theſe ſenſes, the Covenant doth command perfect obedience? you anſwer,<note place="margin">An explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> 
                        <hi>All the doubt is of the three lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> one of which is, <hi>Promiſes, Prophecies, and Types, before Chriſt's comming.</hi> And to ſpeak mine own meaning, (and <hi>I</hi> had thought, no man had doubted of it) <hi>I</hi> take Covenant of grace in this diſpute, for the whole tranſaction that paſſes, in a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-way betwixt God and his people, in order to Salvation, as comprizing all that God requires, promiſes, or threats, and all that to which man engages himſelf, and which he expects. But when <hi>I</hi> ſpeak of that which the Covenant, thus taken, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth; I mean that which it promiſeth in the promiſſory part of it: when I ſpeak of what it threatneth, I mean in the Mina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory part of it: and when I ſpeak of what it requires, I mean in the preceptive part of it. Now this preceptive part muſt needs have ſome rule, at which men in Covenant muſt look, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from threats or promiſes, and containing <hi>Agenda,</hi> things to be done, and not <hi>Credenda, Speranda,</hi> or <hi>Timenda,</hi> things to be <hi>Believed, Hoped,</hi> or <hi>Feared.</hi> The rule, or Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard here, in theſe things, which man in Covenant is called to do, is the Moral Law: God quits not man of his Subjection: He is a ſubject in this, as he was in the former Covenant.

                        </gap>ace cals us to eye it, and with ſincere endeavour to conform to it. When God ſpake to <hi>Abraham</hi> (the leading man in Covenant reſpective to all after-Covenanters, whether Jewes, or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,) he ſaith, <hi>I am the Almighty God, or God al-ſufficient, walk before me, and be thou perfect,</hi> Gen. 17.1. In which words, we have firſt the parties in Covenant, and the engagement of either party. Gods engagement is to be to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Almighty, and Al-ſufficient for protection, for proviſion, ſo that, he need not look elſe-where to compaſs good, or keep off evill. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> Engagement is, to walk before God, and to be perfect, or, as it is in the Margent reading, <hi>upright, ſincere:</hi> which walking ſaith <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> comprehendeth both <hi>true faith,</hi> Heb. 11.5, 6.
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:168215:331"/> and <hi>carefull obedience to God's Commandments.</hi> That faith is called for in this perfection, ſee 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.8, 9. To rely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone upon God in one verſe, is to be perfect in the other. That this perfection of ſervice, of obedience, is no other then ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, all interpreters that I have ſeen, acknowledge. See <hi>Peter Martyr, Vaetablus, Paraeus, Calvin</hi> on the place. <hi>God Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants for obedience,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Calvin) from his ſervant; and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, which is here mentioned, is oppoſed</hi> to hypocriſie. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet</hi> cloſeth with <hi>Calvin,</hi> and in many words expreſſeth himſelf, that this perfection means nothing elſe, but integrity, or ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, otherwiſe (ſaith he) <hi>they that walk, and are yet in the way, do not attain to a perfection properly ſo called.</hi> So that according to him, the Covenant requires the ſame, that through grace the Saints here attain, and that is a perfection not property ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> on the words is very large to this purpoſe. As for that which you produce as an opinion of an acquaintance, &amp; friend of mine of extraordinary learning and judgement (lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving me to gueſs whom you mean, as indeed I do, but with poſſibility of miſtake) That the Morall Law is the matter of the new Covenant; I cannot well underſtand, at leaſt as you expreſs it. How far the word [matter] may reach, I know not. I believe, that it is their Rule in the New Covenant, but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe held out, then it was in the Covenant of works, as I have before expreſſed my ſelf. As a Law, it loſes nothing of it's ancient ſtrictneſs, for it is ever unchangeably the ſame; the rule of our duty, and not of our ſtrength; onely the terms of the Covenant of Grace, are not for <hi>exact obſervation,</hi> but <hi>ſincere en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour.</hi> So that the leaſt failing is a ſin againſt the Law, but not a breach of Covenant; which for ought I diſcern is the ſenſe that you give. As for that which in the ſecond place you urge from him, whom you ſtile, <hi>Learned, Judicious, and much Honoured Brother, and my friend and acquaintance;</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king theſe two, but one Law <hi>quo ad formam, I command thee fal'n man, perfect obedience; and oblige thee to puniſhment for every ſin: yet not remedileſly, but ſo, as that if thou Believe and Repent, this obligation ſhall be diſſolved, &amp; thou ſaved, elſe not.</hi> I ſhould rather take them <hi>disjunctim</hi> then <hi>conjunctim,</hi> but <hi>I</hi> know not whether there be any conſiderable difference. <hi>I</hi> ſo far ſubſcribe, that all that periſh by the ſentence of the Law, to whom the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was ever tendered, are by neglect of Covenant, left in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medileſs
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:168215:331"/> condition. The Law damns the unbeliever and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent: unbelief holds him, that he is not by the Covenant of Grace delivered from the Law's ſentence. When you come to bring all home, by application to me, with your cenſure for laying an heavy charge upon them that I oppoſe, and apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gizing on their part; I do not well know how to underſtand your words, that ſo I might ſee my own error. You ſay, <hi>It is moſt likely, that thoſe Divines that affirm, that the Covenant of Grace doth require perfect obedience, and accepts ſincere, do take that Covenant in this laſt and largeſt ſenſe, and as containing the Moral Law, as part of the matter.</hi> Before you ſpake of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law, as the matter of the Covenant, and now you ſpeak of it, as part of the matter, <hi>And ſo underſtood,</hi> (you ſay) <hi>No doubt it is true, if I underſtand it of perfection for the future.</hi> And then doubtleſs it is an error, for I underſtand perfection for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; And what the Law of God, or Covenant do's require, it doth in preſent, as I think, require: And what gave you occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſuſpect otherwiſe, I cannot imagin. When you have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon you their defence, or at leaſt their excuſe, that hold againſt you, you come to anſwer my arguments, that hold with you.</p>
                     <p>I ſaid, [This opinion,<note place="margin">Arguments that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace requires one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſincerity vindicated.</note> That the Covenant requires perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, eſtabliſhes the former opinion oppoſed by Proteſtants, and but now refuted, as to the obedience, and the degree of it cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for in-covenant.] You anſwer, <hi>If you interpret the Papiſts as meaning that the Law requires true perfection, but accepts of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, then if it be ſpoken of the Law of works, or nature, it is falſe, and not the ſame with theirs whom you oppoſe. Anſw.</hi> I marvail that you will put the caſe [if I do] when <hi>I</hi> tell you expreſly that <hi>I</hi> do not. <hi>I</hi> limit the parallel to the obedience, and degree cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for in Covenant, which theſe Reverend Divines make to be the ſame, as thoſe that <hi>I</hi> had ſpoken to, but differ reſpective to acceptation: and ſo their miſtake, if it be one, is infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Popiſh error in the Councill of Trent held forth, which <hi>I</hi> did oppoſe. You further ſay, <hi>If you take them, as no doubt you do, as meaning it of the Law of Chriſt, as the Trent Council ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs themſelves; then no doubt but they take the Law of Chriſt, in the ſame extended ſenſe, as was before expreſſed: and then they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from us but in the fore-mentioned notion. Anſw. I</hi> do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand your diſtinction between the Law of nature, and the
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:168215:332"/> Law of Chriſt, as <hi>I</hi> have before largely told you, and given in my reaſons. You ſpeak ſomewhat in that which follows, that <hi>the Papiſts do not indeed take the Covenant or Law it ſelf to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand true perfection, but that which they call perfection, which is no other then the grace of Sanctification, as I expreſſed out of ſome of the chief of the writers: But it is true perfection that thoſe mean whom I now write againſt.</hi> And ſo you conclude, that you ſee not the leaſt ground for my firſt charge. But you might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what I further ſay in words more at large, then is here fit to he repeated, purpoſely to prevent this objection, that they look upon this, which we ſay is no more then <hi>Sanctification,</hi> as full <hi>Perfection;</hi> and ſuch that anſwers to the Law in the ſenſe in which it was given. Our <hi>character of grace inherent</hi> is their <hi>interpretation of the Law:</hi> and ſo they raiſe up men in a conceit that they anſwer the Law, when they live in a continual breach of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I ſaid, [If this opinion ſtand, then God accepts of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-breakers, of thoſe that deal falſly in it, whereas Scripture chargeth it upon the wicked, upon thoſe of whom God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, as rebellious, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.25. <hi>Joſ.</hi> 7.15. <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.10. and 22.8, 9.] &amp;c. You anſwer, <hi>This charge proceedeth meerely from the confounding of the duty as ſuch, and the condition as ſuch;</hi> And you proceed <hi>ex non conceſſis,</hi> to charge me with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; taking it for granted in the words that follow, <hi>that a Covenant, which is alſo a Law, as well as a Covenant, may by the preceptive part, conſtitute much more duty then ſhall be made the condition of the promiſes.</hi> In which I conceive there is a double miſtake. 1. That a Covenant properly ſo called (of which we ſpeak can be a Law in the proper acceptation. For a covenant is of 2. parties, either of both concurring to the conſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of it, &amp; if it be a Law, both parties are as well Law-givers, as Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-makers. A Superiour may impoſe a condition as by a Law, but that is but one part of a Covenant. 2. That there is any <hi>duty</hi> in a Covenant, that is not alſo of the <hi>Condition</hi> of it. I am ſure in the Covenant of Grace there is nothing <hi>duty,</hi> which is not a <hi>condition.</hi> Faith and Repentance are <hi>conditions,</hi> and if you can tell me of any thing elſe which is matter of <hi>duty,</hi> taking Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in its due latitude, <hi>viz.</hi> to ceaſe to do evill, and learne to do well, it will be a piece of a new Catechiſme with me; Theſe you grant are <hi>conditions,</hi> and this the [all] of a Chriſtians
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:168215:332"/> 
                        <hi>duty.</hi> Whereas you ſay, If you will ſpeak ſo largely as to ſay, <hi>All who break the preceptive part of the Covenant, are Covenant-breakers, then no doubt God accepteth of many ſuch, and none but ſuch — for Whether we ſay,</hi> (ſay you) <hi>that the New Law commandeth perfect obedience, or not, yet except you take it exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſtrainedly, it muſt be acknowledged, that the precept is of larger extent then the condition, having appointed ſome duties which it hath not made</hi> ſine qua non <hi>to ſalvation. Anſw.</hi> I think God accepts of none that break the preceptive part of the Covenant, in the ſenſe, as the preceptive part of it <hi>qua</hi> Covenant, is to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> underſtood; &amp; as interpreters uſually give as the meaning of it. God accepts (that I know) none (to ſpeak <hi>de adultis</hi>) but thoſe that walk before him, and are ſincere. He neither accepts of profaneneſſe, nor men of hypocriticall diſſimulation. I know <hi>ſincerity</hi> hath its latitude, as <hi>perfection</hi> ſtrictly taken hath not: An upright heart in temptations hath many a great ſhock; but if you can ſay, that the duty of the Covenant is ſo laid aſide, that the heart is not right in the ſight of God, as <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> (which muſt be ſaid if the precept of ſincerity and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righthneſſe be broke) then I do not know that there is any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> muſt be in another frame, before the thoughts of his heart be forgiven him. And this I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident is the thoughts of my learned friend whom you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if I do not (as I think I do not) miſtake the man: And I have my reaſon for this confident opinion. And as I wonder at your diſtinction betwixt the <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>condition</hi> of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſo I no leſſe marvail at your Simile. You tell me, <hi>If I ſend my Child a mile of an errand, and ſay, I charge you, play not by the way, but make haſt, and do not go in the dirt, &amp;c. and if you come back by ſuch an houre, I will give you ſuch a reward; if not, you ſhall be whipt; He that plaies by the way &amp; dirties himſelf; &amp; yet comes back by the houre appointed, doth break the preceptive part, but not the condition.</hi> Your diſtinction is between the preceptive part, and the condition in a Covenant, and here you talke of a precept that is no part of the Covenant; but if I put all within the Covenant, and ſay, Come again within an houre, not playing, or dirtying your ſelf; if he either out ſtay his houre, or play, or run in the dirt, he forfeites his reward, and is at mercy for a whipping, according to Covenant. You ſpeak afterward of a mans breach of ſome particular Covenant, which
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:168215:333"/> a man may do in a temptation; and yet as to the Covenant of grace, be ſincere.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I ſaid, [Then it will follow, that as none can ſay, They have ſo anſwered the command of the Law that they have never failed; So neither can they with the Church make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to God that they have not dealt faſly in the Covenant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44 17. Every ſin (according to this opinion) being a breach of it, and a dealing faſly in it.] You reply, <hi>This charge is as unjuſt as the former.</hi> I confeſſe it, and you giving no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon, I ſhall ſit down with the former anſwer.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. I ſaid, [Then the great promiſe of mercy from everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting to everlaſting upon them that fear him, and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe unto Childrens Children to ſuch as keep his Covenant, and to thoſe that remember his Commands to do them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.17, 18. only appertaines to thoſe that keep the Law, that they ſin not at all againſt it.] You anſwer, <hi>It follows not: If they ſincerely keep the Law, they fulfill the conditions of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, though not the precept.</hi> And I ſay, the precept of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant goes no higher then ſincerity: And I had thought you had fully concurred with me. <hi>That Chriſt</hi> (ſay you) <hi>as the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of the new Covenant ſhould command us not only ſincere but perfect obedience to the moral law; &amp; ſo hath made it a proper part of his Goſpel, not only as a directory and inſtruction, but alſo as a command, I am not yet convinced: Adding, My reaſon is, becauſe I know not to what end Chriſt ſhould command us that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which he never doth enable any man in this life to performe.</hi> Aphor. 157, 158. How theſe can be reconciled, I know not. I think none is inabled through grace to be more then ſincere: and then the precept of the Covenant according to you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no more. You further ſay, <hi>They keep the precept in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, but uſuall ſenſe, as keeping is taken for ſuch a leſſe degree of breaking as on Goſpel grounds is accepted. Anſw.</hi> They keep it, if they be ſincere, in the ſenſe as Chriſt the Mediator of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant gave it, &amp; in as proper a ſenſe as they keep the conditions.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. I ſaid, [Then our Baptiſm-vow is never to ſin againſt God, and as often as we renew our Covenant, we do not only humble our ſelves that we have ſinned, but we afreſh bind our ſelves never more to commit the leaſt infirmity.] To this you anſwer, <hi>We do not promiſe in Baptiſm to do all that the precept of the Covenant requireth, but all that is made the condition of

                     <p n="6">6.

So that your diſtinction fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as I doubt not but it do's, all my arguments after the firſt to the laſt, <hi>eo nomine</hi> ſtand. You go about to evade them all

                     <p>But before I undertake your next, I have to thank you for that which you have tranſcribed out of <hi>Robert Baronius,</hi> pag. 401. of your Confeſſion. Treating in an Appendix <hi>of the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of fulfilling the Law of God, conſidered according to Goſpel lenity,</hi> you tell us what his ſecond aſſertion is, <hi>pag.</hi> 122. which I deſire the Reader to peruſe, either in your book, or in the Author himſelf: Where he may ſee, 1. <hi>That the Goſpel is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Law, as to the degree that it requireth.</hi> As to the one there is a poſſibility of fulfilling, (according to him) and not ſo to the other. 2. <hi>That the obligation of the Law yet remains, ſo that all failings are tranſgreſſions.</hi> 3. <hi>That it ſtands as a Rule for us to affect, and with our beſt ſtrength to endeavour after.</hi> 4. <hi>That the Goſpel requires a certain meaſure of obedience, on pain of eternal damnation.</hi> This doubtleſs is that which is the condition of it. 5. <hi>That this obedience thus required, is neceſſarily to be, as high as grace enables to reach.</hi> In which we ſee in the firſt place, their diſtinction oppoſed, that ſay, That the Goſpel requires perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and accepts ſincerity. The Goſpel according to him requires no more then it accepts, and for which grace ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. And in the next place, your diſtinction of <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> is by him utterly overthrown, according to him, all comes within the condition, which is matter of duty.</p>
                     <p>My laſt argument was, [Then it follows, that ſincerity is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver called for as a duty, or required as a grace, but only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpens'd with, as a failing, and indulged, as a want. It is not ſo much a Chriſtian's honour, or Character, as his blemiſh; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his defect, then praiſe. But we find the contrary in <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, Job,</hi> &amp;c.] To this you reply, <hi>I will not ſay, it is paſt the wit of man to find the ground of this charge,</hi> i. e. <hi>to ſee how this ſhould follow; but I dare ſay, it is paſt my wit. If it had been ſaid, The Covenant commandeth perfection, and not ſincerity, or the Covenant accepteth ſincerity, but not commandeth it, there would have been ſome reaſon for this charge. But do you think that ſincerity is no part of perfection, &amp;c? Anſw.</hi> My wit is ſo low, that I know not where the cloud lies. I do not take ſincerity to be properly a part of perfection, but a degree towards it; as <hi>Calor ad unum,</hi> is a degree towards, rather then a part of <hi>Calor ad octo,</hi> So the lower deg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="645" facs="tcp:168215:334"/> and not be ſwallowed up in it. And if the command looks no lower then perfection in degree, the imperfect degree is not directly commanded, though (according to theſe) it is in dulged. It is ſaid <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.20. that Chriſt <hi>will not break the bruiſed Reed, nor quench the ſmoaking Flax.</hi> Is that feeble ſtrength, and remiſs heat, there look'd upon as a duty; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it not look'd upon as a defect, or want? Is it not Chriſt's indulgence, rather then the obedience of his command, that is there noted or pointed out?</p>
                     <p>My anſwer to the ſingle argument, (ſo far as I have read, or heard, againſt that which I here delivered) follows. But, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that your reply, ſo far as I can judge, is rather with me, then againſt me, as to the Poſition it ſelf; and your endeavour, rather to excuſe, then defend thoſe of the contrary opinion, (which very well pleaſeth me, for I wiſh that more were ſaid for their honour, ſo that the truth do not ſuffer) I am well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to paſs it by, having a greater deſire to defend you, where you ſpeak for truth, then my ſelf, where not truth, but my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation is impugned: And ſhall make it my buſineſs to look into that, which Mr. <hi>Crandon</hi> hath againſt you in it.

The Text quoted out of <hi>James,</hi> ſerves well to explain the reſt, <hi>Let pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, nothing,</hi> whence we may argue, 1. That perfection which Chriſtians may attain, is the perfection that the Apoſtle calls unto, This is plain in the Text, he calls for perfection, that we may perfect: But Chriſtians can reach no further a degree in perfection then ſincerity; Therefore the Apoſtle calls onely to ſincerity. 2. That is the Apoſtles meaning, where he ſpeaks of perfection, that himſelf gives in as his meaning; This is cleer, he
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:168215:335"/> is the beſt interpreter of himſelf. But he expreſſes himſelf by <hi>perfect</hi> there to mean <hi>entire,</hi> or <hi>lacking nothing.</hi> A perfection of entireneſs, or integrality then he means, a perfection of parts, and not of degrees. For that Text of <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. <hi>Finally brethren, farewell, be perfect,</hi> &amp;c. let us compare with it, that which he teſtifies of ſome in <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1 Cor. 2.6. <hi>Howbeit we ſpeak wiſdome among them that are perfect,</hi> that is, thoſe that have a right and more full underſtanding of Goſpel myſteries, put in oppoſition to the weakneſs of novices, which perfection is, (according to the Apoſtle) the way to unity of judgment. As for the Text, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.48. <hi>Be ye therefore perfect, as your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in heaven is perfect,</hi> If it be ſtreined to the higheſt, it calls for a divine, increated perfection, Mr. <hi>Crandon</hi> then muſt yield, that there is a <hi>ſicut ſimilitudinis, non aequalitatis,</hi> in that place. And if the context be conſulted, we ſhall find, that it is oppoſed to that half-hypocriticall righteouſneſs, which was found in Scribes and Phariſees; which all muſt exceed that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdome of heaven. In <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. a novice-like imperfection in knowledge, is reproved; and a further growth towards perfection is called for.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Crandon</hi> goes on, <hi>If perfection were not the duty of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and unperfectneſs, and infirmity his ſin, why doth the Apoſtle groan, and grieve under the remainder of his natural infirmities, and preſs on to perfection,</hi> Rom. 7.14. to the 24. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12, 14? The concluſion here is granted; the one is a duty, the other is a ſin, and becauſe of failing in the one, and the burden of the other, the Apoſtle groans. Foreſeeing that this would be yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, he addes by way of objection, <hi>Or is ſuch unperfectneſs a ſin onely in reference to the rule of the Law, and not the Rule of the Goſpel, or that the Law doth, but the Goſpel doth not call for perfection? Anſw.</hi> There is not one rule of the Law, as I have demonſtrated at large, and another of the Goſpel, ſeeing the Goſpel eſtabliſhes the Law; onely the Goſpel-Covenant calls for thoſe ſincere deſires, which grace works to conform in its meaſure to the Rule of the Law. He addes. <hi>This is both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Scriptures alleaged, and doth withall make the Goſpel to allow imperfections.</hi> But both of theſe have been already an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd. What he further addes, anſwers it ſelf, ſave onely his great pains to pump out your meaning. But I ſhall leave you to be your own interpreter, and forbear in this to interpoſe between you.</p>

<pb n="649" facs="tcp:168215:336"/> ſpeak any ſuch priority, I have been longer (<hi>I</hi> think) exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in theſe ſtudies, which is all that I have to plead, and I wiſh it had been with more ſerious diligence; It is my way then to keep ſilence; Though many may think that you are ſcarce ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, in judging all of theſe to be neceſſary requiſites, in any that ſhall take upon them ſuch boldneſs; ſeeing you ſeem not to tye your ſelf up to this Rule, in your dealings with others.

Yea where is there the man, almoſt in the world, that hears not that charge from your pen? More then once you charge error, on Reverend Dr. <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> Prolocutor (while he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) of the late Aſſembly; in ſpeaking for juſtification of of Infidels (as you call it,) and making it an immanent act in God, warning younger Students to be wary in their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of him. In whoſe behalf Mr. <hi>Jeſſop</hi> hath ſtood up as an advocate, not pleading juſtification in his name, but not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; In which I ſhall not interpoſe. My judgement in the thing is ſufficiently known. You charge the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> that ſet him up in that honour, in like ſort; entring your diſſent from their <hi>larger Catechiſm</hi> in four paſſages, from their <hi>confeſſion</hi> in ſix, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring onely indeed, a liberty of expounding, but in ſeveral of them you well know that your expoſition was none of their meaning, which you do not obſcurely ſignifie, in the different expreſſion of your ſelf, in your diſſent from them, and from the Synod of <hi>Dort.</hi> You charge the <hi>pious Miniſtry</hi> of this Nation in general (out of whom that Aſſembly was gathered) in the Preface of your Confeſſion, with error in their thoughts about Church Diſcipline, and if information do not deceive me, as full an Aſſembly of Learned, and pious Miniſters, as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently live for ſuch a meeting together, in any part of the Nation, after a full debate of that which you charge as an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, determined it againſt you.

Now for a man to think, that you judge your ſelf above all theſe, in this gradation mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in every one of thoſe enumerated qualifications, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:168215:337"/> to challenge, both your humility and modeſty. Your Readers then muſt conclude, that either you were not ſerious in your Liſt given in; or elſe you take liberty to tranſgreſs your own Rules, and ſet upon that work your ſelf, which you will not allow in others. After quotation of ſeverall paſſages of the Fathers (with which all muſt vote) you ſeem to prefer one of <hi>Auſtin</hi> above all, <hi>contra rationem nemo ſobrius, contra Scripturas nemo Chriſtianus, contra eccleſiam nemo pacificus;</hi> Making that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this, as you have done of none of the other, That <hi>in the point of faiths inſtrumentality,</hi> and <hi>the nature of the juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing act,</hi> taking in afterwards <hi>the intereſt of mans obedience in juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as it is conſummate in judgement, you are conſtrained upon all theſe three grounds to give in your diſſent.</hi> I can perſwade none to abjure Chriſtianity, renounce reaſon, and make a ſchiſme in the Church (as it ſeems you think you muſt do) to come over to me; and yeelding (as cleerly enough you do) that I have this little corner of the world, whereſoever Proteſtants dwell, for an hundred and fifty yeers paſt on my ſide, ſure you ſtand amazed, that none of all theſe men, in ſo long a ſpace of time, can either be brought to the ſight of reaſon, or to a right underſtanding of Scriptures, or yet to returne to that unity, from which they have in ſo foul a Schiſm departed. Theſe points, on the two firſt grounds, have been brought already (as well as I can do it) to the teſt; In which you ſee, my reaſon againſt yours; and my ſenſe of Scriptures, againſt that which you have given; The third onely doth remain to be enquired into, and I cannot yet believe that the Church is my adverſary. And here you ſeem to put me fairly to it. <hi>If you will bring</hi> (ſay you) <hi>one ſound reaſon, one word of Scripture, or one approved writer of the Church, (yea or one Heretick, or any man whatſoever) for many hundred years after Chriſt (I think I may ſay</hi> 1300. <hi>at leaſt) to prove that Chriſt, as Lord, or King, is not the object of the juſtifying act of faith, or that faith juſtifieth properly as inſtrument,</hi> I am contented ſo far to loſe the reputation of my reaſon, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, reading, and memory. You ſpeak this, you ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>I tell you, there was ſcarce a diſſenting voyce among our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines againſt me about the inſtrumentality of faith,</hi> and if (ſay you) <hi>there cannot be brought one man that conſenteth with them for</hi> 1200. <hi>or</hi> 1400. <hi>years after Chriſt, I pray you tell me, whom an humble and modeſt peaceable man ſhould follow? Anſw.</hi> For rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:168215:337"/> or Scripture, I ſhall bring no more then I have done, I think you may ſee both, in that which I have already written. The Churches teſtimony onely now remains to be looked after, whether you, or I can lay the fairer claime; and here you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh of it. 1. As it was for the firſt 1200, 1300, 1400 yeers after Chriſt, for you name all of theſe Periods. 2. As it hath been for 150. yeers now paſt. The Church for one full hundred yeers at leaſt, it ſeems by you, ſtood Newter, <hi>viz.</hi> from 1400. to 1500. The Church for this little ſcantling of time, <hi>viz.</hi> for 150. yeers is not denyed by you to vote with me, if the Proteſtant party to which you joyn in communion, may deſerve that name. But for all that ſpace as before, it was (as you pretend) unanimouſly yours; at well the Orthodox, as the Hereticall party in it. Here, for further diſcovering of truth, two things ſhould be enquired into. 1. Whether he, more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily deſerves the name of an enemy of the Churches peace, that diſſents in judgement from the Church in ſome particulars, as in ages paſt it was; or he that confeſſedly diſſents from the Church whereof he is, and where he lives, and as that preſent, it ſtands? I think, here the determination is eaſie; Let us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whether of theſe diſſents will work more heart-broyles, quarrels, contentions, envyings, mutuall oppoſitions, and needleſs diſputes, and let that be agreed upon (as well it may) to bear the blame. If all muſt be tyed up to keep peace, and be at one with the Church, as to all particular tenents, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of all theſe ages, they are then tyed to know, and their Paſtors are bound to teach, what in all ſucceſſive ages hath been the Churches opinion. But this were a great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den for Paſtors, and far more intolerable to be put upon the people. If a man may be ſecure in this, that he goeth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt truth, I think he need not trouble himſelf as to ages paſt, in the matter of peace. Had you produced the vote of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, as a probable inducement to perſwade, that you had truth according to Scripture, and reaſon, on your part, it had been ſomewhat, ſuch appeals to humane Authority, after Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Teſtimony produced, is ordinary; but to diſſent from the Church, in which a man lives, and of which he is, to avoid the danger of a breach of peace, with the Church that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times was, is ſuch a way of peace, that I never yet knew tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, or taken: 2. Whether Antiquity be as cleer for you, as
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:168215:338"/> the Church in preſent is for me? The latter you freely grant, but the former will, I think, hardly be yeelded, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding what you ſay, <hi>Becauſe a word, or an opinion, that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound, hath got poſſeſſion of a little corner of the world for about</hi> 150 <hi>yeers; therefore I am ſuſpected as a noveliſt, for forſaking it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is to avoid ſingularity, and notorious novelty, that I aſſent not to your way.

If it be the want of the words only [<hi>inſtrument,</hi> or <hi>quà Lord</hi>] that you mention, your charge is very low, upon ſeverall accounts. 1.

You would be (I doubt not) as much wanting in making proofe of the uſe of your own termes among the Fathers, as your adverſaries of theirs; we may find the word <hi>[in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument]</hi> and the reſtrictive particle <hi>[quà]</hi> in your twenty ſix Fathers, aſcribed to Faith in Juſtification, as oft as you can find your <hi>cauſa ſine quâ non,</hi> or, as I think, your <hi>conditio cum quâ.</hi> We may likewiſe find that diſtinction of <hi>fides qua,</hi> and <hi>fides quà,</hi> which you make the <hi>generall cheat,</hi> as often as you can find your diſtinctions already examined, which <hi>Pag.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. you heap together; When you challenge the words of others, as novel; it lies upon you, to aſſert the antiquity of your own. If it be the thing it ſelf, that you challenge, as not found in any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors in this Compaſſe of time, I believe you will not be found ſo happy in your defence of this provocation, as <hi>B.

And when Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is at the higheſt, and obedience at the beſt, it is not repentance, nor obedience; but the bloud of Chriſt, in which faith alone intereſts us, that muſt be our diſcharge. So that, if I may take the boldneſs to interpoſe my thoughts, as to that multitude of quotations which you have produced, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of works in juſtification; I think for the greateſt part, they labour of that Fallacy, called <hi>Ignoratio Elenchi.</hi> Put them into Syllogiſtical form, and the Reader ſhall find, that they do not conclude the thing in queſtion.

Whoſe teſtimony I have produced at large, <hi>p.</hi> 434. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thither I here refer you, Where you may ſee the ſole intereſt of faith, the inſtrumentall efficiency, or cauſality of it, with an utter deniall of any intereſt of works in this of juſtification. So that he alone may ſpeak for all; that the acknowledgement of the intereſt of works, according to the tenor of the Covenant, as a way ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:168215:346"/> of God for attainment of glory, doth not argue any intereſt at all of works in the work of juſtification.</p>
                     <p>But to return to that from which theſe quotations have cauſed this ſhort digreſſion. I think you might have ſpared thoſe words, <hi>If I were on one ſide, and all the Divines in</hi> England <hi>on the other, there is yet the ſame reaſon to prefer all the firſt Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all them, as there is to prefer all them before me. In a word, I ſhall ever think him more culpably ſingular, who differeth from Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, and all his Church for</hi> 1200. or 1400. <hi>yeers, then he that differeth from any party now living, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not from them forementioned,</hi> Unleſs you could make it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appear, that Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, and the Church for this ſpace of time, were more cleerly for you. It is the Churches Teſtimony, that is now our buſineſs; and if the Reader have no more then <hi>Chemnitius</hi> bare word, affirming with ſo much confidence, as we have heard, that all ages have been againſt you, it is enough againſt your bare word, that all former ages have been for you.</p>
                     <p>You now ſee my thoughts, how they ſtand upon the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of that part of your Apology, in which I am concerned. Though it be above my hopes to give you ſatisfaction, yet others I doubt not wil be more flexible in their opinion. What you wil pleaſe to do further, I know not, it is enough that I underſtand my own mind; which is (ſo far as I can before-hand reſolve) not to intermeddle further, and whatſoever I ſhall hear from you, to impoſe ſilence on my ſelf. You have drawn me out to ſpeak what is here ſaid, in my own juſt defence. If this will not do it, I ſhall think it will not be done. Let me requeſt that Chriſtian Candor, that the Common cauſe may not ſuffer; and that you will not dwell on literall miſtakes, or unaptneſs, (as you may conceive, ſometimes) of the phraſe, but take that which you ſhall judge to be my full meaning, which I have made my buſineſs, as fully as I can, to make known. I have no more to make yours, or the Readers trouble, but ſhall leave all to your candid interpretation, and his impartiall cenſure, and not onely ſubſcribe, but with unfeigned reſolution (by the help of grace) remain in acknowledgement of your manifold eminent graces,</p>
